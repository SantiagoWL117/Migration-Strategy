## Implementation Details

### 1. Cuisine Taxonomy System ✅

**cuisine_types** - Master list of cuisine categories
- **Purpose:** Standardized cuisine categorization for restaurant discovery
- **Columns:**
  - `id` (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)
  - `name` (VARCHAR 100, UNIQUE) - Display name
  - `slug` (VARCHAR 100, UNIQUE) - URL-friendly identifier
  - `description` (TEXT) - Detailed description
  - `icon_url` (VARCHAR 500) - Icon for UI
  - `display_order` (INTEGER) - Sort order in UI
  - `is_active` (BOOLEAN) - Enable/disable cuisines
  - `created_at`, `updated_at` - Audit trail

**restaurant_cuisines** - Many-to-many link between restaurants and cuisines
- **Purpose:** A restaurant can have multiple cuisine types
- **Columns:**
  - `id` (BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY)
  - `restaurant_id` (FK to restaurants)
  - `cuisine_type_id` (FK to cuisine_types)
  - `is_primary` (BOOLEAN) - Main cuisine for the restaurant
  - `created_at` - Audit trail
- **Unique Constraint:** One cuisine type per restaurant (no duplicates)
- **Unique Index:** Only one primary cuisine per restaurant

---

### 2. Cuisine Types Seeded ✅

Based on analysis of 963 restaurants in the database, the following 20 cuisine types were created:

| # | Cuisine Type | Slug | Restaurants Tagged |
|---|--------------|------|-------------------|
| 1 | Pizza | pizza | **257** (26.7%) |
| 2 | Chinese | chinese | 22 (2.3%) |
| 3 | Italian | italian | **64** (6.6%) |
| 4 | Lebanese | lebanese | **35** (3.6%) |
| 5 | Thai | thai | 26 (2.7%) |
| 6 | Vietnamese | vietnamese | **39** (4.0%) |
| 7 | Japanese | japanese | 7 (0.7%) |
| 8 | Sushi | sushi | **37** (3.8%) |
| 9 | Greek | greek | 14 (1.5%) |
| 10 | American | american | 0 (ready for manual tagging) |
| 11 | Burgers | burgers | 0 (ready for manual tagging) |
| 12 | Shawarma | shawarma | 0 (included in Lebanese pattern) |
| 13 | Pita & Wraps | pita-wraps | 0 (included in Lebanese pattern) |
| 14 | BBQ | bbq | 0 (ready for manual tagging) |
| 15 | Asian Fusion | asian-fusion | 0 (ready for manual tagging) |
| 16 | Sandwiches & Subs | sandwiches-subs | 0 (ready for manual tagging) |
| 17 | Breakfast & Brunch | breakfast | 0 (ready for manual tagging) |
| 18 | Noodle House | noodle-house | 7 (0.7%) |
| 19 | Mediterranean | mediterranean | 0 (ready for manual tagging) |

**Key Insights:**
- **Pizza** is by far the most common cuisine (257 restaurants = 26.7%)
- **Italian** is second (64 restaurants = 6.6%)
- **Vietnamese, Sushi, and Lebanese** are well-represented (35-39 each)
- Several cuisines ready for manual tagging (American, Burgers, BBQ, etc.)

### 3. Auto-Tagging Logic ✅

**Pattern Matching Algorithm:**
Restaurants were automatically tagged based on name analysis using regex patterns:

| Pattern | Cuisine | Example Matches |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| `(pizza\|pizzeria)` | Pizza | "Milano Pizza", "Pizzeria Napoli" |
| `(chinese\|wok\|oriental)` | Chinese | "Oriental Express", "Wok Box" |
| `(milano\|italian\|lasagna\|pasta)` | Italian | "Milano", "Italian Kitchen" |
| `(lebanese\|shawarma\|pita)` | Lebanese | "Lebanese Cuisine", "Shawarma Palace" |
| `indian` | Indian | "Indian Delight" |
| `thai` | Thai | "Thai Express" |
| `(vietnamese\|pho)` | Vietnamese | "Pho House", "Vietnamese Kitchen" |
| `japan` | Japanese | "Japanese Bistro" |
| `sushi` | Sushi | "Sushi Bar" |
| `(greek\|souvlaki)` | Greek | "Greek Taverna", "Souvlaki House" |
| `noodle` | Noodle House | "Noodle House" |

**Results:**
- **521 restaurants** (54.1%) successfully auto-tagged
- **442 restaurants** (45.9%) require manual review
- All auto-tagged restaurants marked as `is_primary = true`

---

### 4. Restaurant Tags System ✅

**restaurant_tags** - Master list of feature tags
- **Purpose:** Tag restaurants with features beyond cuisine
- **Categories:**
  - `dietary` - Dietary options (Halal, Vegetarian, Vegan, Gluten-Free)
  - `service` - Service types (Delivery, Pickup, Dine-In)
  - `atmosphere` - Ambiance (Family Friendly)
  - `feature` - Special features (Late Night)
  - `payment` - Payment methods (Cash, Credit Card)

**restaurant_tag_assignments** - Many-to-many link
- Links restaurants to their feature tags
- Unique constraint prevents duplicate assignments

---

### 5. Tags Seeded ✅

**11 common tags created across 5 categories:**

#### Dietary Tags (4)
- Halal
- Vegetarian Options
- Vegan Options
- Gluten-Free Options

#### Service Tags (3)
- Delivery
- Pickup
- Dine-In

#### Atmosphere Tags (1)
- Family Friendly

#### Feature Tags (1)
- Late Night

#### Payment Tags (2)
- Accepts Cash
- Accepts Credit Card

**Note:** Tag assignments are ready but not yet populated. These will be added manually or via future admin interface.

## Use Cases

### 1. Browse by Cuisine
```sql
-- Get all pizza restaurants
SELECT r.id, r.name
FROM menuca_v3.restaurants r
JOIN menuca_v3.restaurant_cuisines rc ON r.id = rc.restaurant_id
JOIN menuca_v3.cuisine_types ct ON rc.cuisine_type_id = ct.id
WHERE ct.slug = 'pizza'
  AND r.status = 'active'
  AND r.deleted_at IS NULL
ORDER BY r.name;
```

### 2. Multi-Cuisine Restaurants
```sql
-- Find restaurants offering multiple cuisines
SELECT 
    r.id,
    r.name,
    array_agg(ct.name ORDER BY rc.is_primary DESC, ct.name) as cuisines
FROM menuca_v3.restaurants r
JOIN menuca_v3.restaurant_cuisines rc ON r.id = rc.restaurant_id
JOIN menuca_v3.cuisine_types ct ON rc.cuisine_type_id = ct.id
WHERE r.deleted_at IS NULL
GROUP BY r.id, r.name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### 3. Cuisine Distribution Report
```sql
-- Get cuisine popularity stats
SELECT 
    ct.name as cuisine,
    COUNT(rc.id) as restaurant_count,
    ROUND(COUNT(rc.id) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM menuca_v3.restaurants WHERE deleted_at IS NULL), 2) as percentage
FROM menuca_v3.cuisine_types ct
LEFT JOIN menuca_v3.restaurant_cuisines rc ON ct.id = rc.cuisine_type_id
GROUP BY ct.id, ct.name
ORDER BY restaurant_count DESC;
```

### 4. Add Cuisine to Restaurant
```sql
-- Add secondary cuisine
INSERT INTO menuca_v3.restaurant_cuisines (restaurant_id, cuisine_type_id, is_primary)
VALUES (123, 3, false) -- Add Italian as secondary cuisine
ON CONFLICT (restaurant_id, cuisine_type_id) DO NOTHING;
```

### 5. Tag Restaurant with Features
```sql
-- Tag restaurant as Halal
INSERT INTO menuca_v3.restaurant_tag_assignments (restaurant_id, tag_id)
SELECT 123, id FROM menuca_v3.restaurant_tags WHERE slug = 'halal'
ON CONFLICT (restaurant_id, tag_id) DO NOTHING;
```

## Data Quality Results

### Auto-Tagging Accuracy

| Metric | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **Total Restaurants** | 963 | 100% |
| **Successfully Auto-Tagged** | 521 | 54.1% |
| **Require Manual Review** | 442 | 45.9% |
| **Pizza Restaurants** | 257 | 26.7% (largest category) |
| **Multi-Cuisine Potential** | 0 | (all tagged with single primary) |

**Coverage by Cuisine:**
- **High Coverage** (50+ restaurants): Pizza (257)
- **Medium Coverage** (20-50 restaurants): Italian (64), Vietnamese (39), Sushi (37), Lebanese (35), Thai (26), Chinese (22)
- **Low Coverage** (1-20 restaurants): Greek (14), Indian (13), Japanese (7), Noodle House (7)
- **No Coverage** (0 restaurants): 9 cuisines ready for manual assignments

## Next Steps for Complete Categorization

### Immediate Actions

1. **Manual Review Required:** 442 restaurants need cuisine assignment
2. **Pattern Enhancement:** Add more regex patterns for under-represented cuisines
3. **Multi-Cuisine Support:** Some restaurants offer multiple cuisines
4. **Tag Population:** Begin tagging restaurants with dietary/service/feature tags

### SQL for Manual Review

```sql
-- List restaurants without cuisine (ordered by activity)
SELECT 
    r.id,
    r.name,
    r.status,
    r.created_at
FROM menuca_v3.restaurants r
WHERE r.deleted_at IS NULL
  AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM menuca_v3.restaurant_cuisines rc 
      WHERE rc.restaurant_id = r.id
  )
ORDER BY 
    CASE r.status
        WHEN 'active' THEN 1
        WHEN 'pending' THEN 2
        ELSE 3
    END,
    r.name
LIMIT 50;
```

### Enhanced Auto-Tagging (Future)

```sql
-- Additional patterns for better coverage
UPDATE menuca_v3.restaurant_cuisines
SET cuisine_type_id = (SELECT id FROM menuca_v3.cuisine_types WHERE slug = 'burgers')
WHERE restaurant_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM menuca_v3.restaurants 
    WHERE LOWER(name) ~ '(burger|burgers|hamburger)'
      AND deleted_at IS NULL
);
```

```sql
-- Try to create duplicate primary cuisine
INSERT INTO menuca_v3.restaurant_cuisines 
    (restaurant_id, cuisine_type_id, is_primary)
VALUES (3, 2, true);
-- Result: UNIQUE CONSTRAINT violation ✅
```

### Test 4: Tags System Ready ✅
