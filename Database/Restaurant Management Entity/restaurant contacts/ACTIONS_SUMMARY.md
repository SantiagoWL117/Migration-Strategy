# Restaurant Contacts - Actions Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-02  
**Review:** Post-migration data quality improvements

---

## Issues Identified

Three issues were identified during the migration review verification:

1. **7 contacts (0.8%) with no email or phone** - Low priority data quality issue
2. **8 contacts (0.96%) with special characters in names** - Very low priority cosmetic issue
3. **receives_* flags all default to FALSE** - Medium priority business decision

---

## Actions Taken

### ‚úÖ Issue 1: Contacts with No Email/Phone - ADDRESSED

**Decision:** Mark as inactive (Option A - Recommended)

**Action:**
- Created SQL script: `fix_contacts_no_info.sql`
- Created documentation: `README_FIX.md`
- Updated verification results document

**What the script does:**
```sql
UPDATE menuca_v3.restaurant_contacts
SET is_active = FALSE, updated_at = NOW()
WHERE (email IS NULL OR email = '') AND (phone IS NULL OR phone = '');
-- Affects: 7 records
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Preserves data history (no deletion)
- ‚úÖ Prevents operational use of invalid contacts
- ‚úÖ Signals to admin that records need attention
- ‚úÖ Safe and reversible

**Status:** ‚è≥ **READY TO EXECUTE** in Supabase SQL Editor

---

### ‚úÖ Issue 2: Special Characters in Names - NO ACTION

**Decision:** Accept as-is (Recommended)

**Rationale:**
- Only 0.96% of records affected (8 out of 835)
- Annotations provide useful context (e.g., "(wife)", "(secondary #)")
- Reflects source data accurately
- No functional impact
- Can be manually cleaned if needed on case-by-case basis

**Examples preserved:**
- "Mehta (wife)" - indicates relationship
- "Rostaee (Secondary #)" - indicates backup contact
- "D'Avignon" - valid French-Canadian name

**Status:** ‚úÖ **CLOSED** - Working as intended

---

### ‚è≥ Issue 3: receives_* Flags - DEFERRED

**Decision:** Business decision deferred (No action at this time)

**Current State:**
- All 835 contacts have `receives_orders = FALSE`
- All 835 contacts have `receives_statements = FALSE`
- All 835 contacts have `receives_marketing = FALSE`

**Options Available:**
- **Option A:** Auto-enable for 819 owners (operational efficiency)
- **Option B:** Leave all FALSE (privacy-first, manual opt-in)
- **Option C:** Hybrid - enable `receives_orders` only for owners

**Why Deferred:**
- Requires business/legal decision
- Not a data integrity issue
- Can be changed at any time
- No operational impact if manual configuration is acceptable

**Status:** ‚è≥ **BUSINESS DECISION PENDING**
