## 📊 Detailed Findings

### ✅ PERFECT Coverage (100%) - 4 Tables

These critical tables have **complete data** for all 101 restaurants:

1. **`restaurant_locations`** (101/101) ✅
   - Every restaurant has a valid location record
   - Includes address, coordinates, phone, email

2. **`restaurant_service_configs`** (101/101) ✅
   - Every restaurant has service configuration
   - Includes delivery/takeout settings, times, discounts

3. **`restaurant_delivery_config`** (101/101) ✅
   - Every restaurant has delivery configuration
   - Includes delivery method, radius, partner config

4. **`restaurant_contacts`** (101/101) ✅
   - All restaurants have contact data (either dedicated contact records OR location phone/email)
   - **3 restaurants** use location data as fallback (IDs: 55, 92, 302)
   - This is a valid design pattern, not missing data

---

### ✅ Expected Gaps (Franchise/Business Logic)

#### 1. Missing Domains (3 Restaurants) - ✅ OK

| V3 ID | Restaurant Name | Reason |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| 16 | Papa Joe's Pizza - Greely & Findlay Creek | Franchise location without individual domain |
| 94 | Milano | Franchise location (1 of 48 Milano locations) |
| 98 | Milano | Franchise location (1 of 48 Milano locations) |

**Root Cause:** These are franchise outlets that never had individual domains in V1/V2.  
**Impact:** ✅ **NONE** - They use parent franchise domains or location-based routing.  
**Action Required:** ❌ **NONE** - This is the expected business state.

---

#### 2. Missing Admin Users (6 Restaurants) - ✅ OK

| V3 ID | Restaurant Name | V1 ID | V2 ID | Status |
|-------|-----------------|-------|-------|--------|
| 8 | Lucky Star Chinese Food | 90 | 1032 | ✅ Never had admins |
| 77 | Lorenzo's Pizzeria - Vanier | 192 | 1101 | ✅ Never had admins |
| 241 | Beneci Pizza | 383 | 1266 | ✅ Never had admins |
| 427 | Papa Joe's Pizza - Bridle Path | 600 | 1452 | ✅ Never had admins |
| 443 | Papa Joe's Fried Chicken - Bridle Path | 620 | 1468 | ✅ Never had admins |
| 468 | Just Wok | 656 | 1493 | ✅ Never had admins |

**Root Cause:** These restaurants never had admin user accounts in V1 or V2.  
**Impact:** 🟡 **LOW** - They likely use call center management or franchise parent accounts.  
**Action Required:** ⏳ **IF REQUESTED** - Create admin accounts manually if restaurants request access.

**Verification:**
- ✅ Checked `staging.v1_restaurant_admin_users` (V1 IDs: 90, 192, 383, 600, 620, 656) → 0 rows
- ✅ Checked `staging.v2_admin_users_restaurants` (V2 IDs: 1032, 1101, 1266, 1452, 1468, 1493) → 0 rows

---

### ✅ RESOLVED: Restaurant 962 (Chicco Pizza)

**Initial Finding:** Restaurant 962 had 3 admin users in V2 that were lost during migration.

**Resolution:** ✅ **RECOVERED**
- **Recovery Script Created:** `recover_restaurant_962_admin_users.sql`
- **Status:** ✅ **EXECUTED** - 3 admin users successfully restored
- **Admin Count:** 3 (verified in `menuca_v3.admin_user_restaurants`)

**Recovered Users:**
