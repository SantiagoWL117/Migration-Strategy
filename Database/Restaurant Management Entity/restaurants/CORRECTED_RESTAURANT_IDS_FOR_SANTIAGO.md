## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes for Santiago

1. **All 101 restaurants are now `status='active'` in production**
2. **Changes were committed on:** 2025-10-14 13:37:08 UTC

   - Restaurant schedules (operating hours)
   - Delivery configurations
   - Menu items (dishes)

5. **Source of truth:** These restaurants were all marked `active='Y'` in V1 database
