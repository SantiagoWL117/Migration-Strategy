## üîç What Caused This Issue?

**Background:**
- Years ago, someone attempted to migrate restaurants from V1 ‚Üí V2
- They prepped data but **never completed** the migration
- **99% of restaurants continued operating from V1**
- These were marked `inactive` in V2 (since they never migrated)

**During V1+V2‚ÜíV3 Migration:**
- Migration logic gave **priority to V2 data**
- V2's incorrect statuses overwrote V1's correct `active` status
- Result: 101 actively operating restaurants showed as suspended/pending in V3

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied

**Priority Rule:** *"If active in EITHER V1 OR V2 ‚Üí active in V3"*

This ensures operational restaurants are correctly marked regardless of which database they were primarily operating from.

---

## üéì Key Takeaways

1. **Always check BOTH sources** for operational status
2. **Active status** should have highest priority across all sources
3. **Staging tables** are invaluable for review and audit
4. **Transaction-wrapped updates** allow safe rollback if issues arise
