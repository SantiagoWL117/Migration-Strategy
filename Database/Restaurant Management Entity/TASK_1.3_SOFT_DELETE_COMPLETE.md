# Task 1.3: Complete Soft Delete Infrastructure - Execution Report

**Executed:** 2025-10-15
**Task:** Complete Soft Delete Infrastructure on Restaurant Child Tables
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

## Summary

**Tables Enhanced:** 5 child tables
**Total Records Protected:** 4,403 records
**Indexes Created:** 5 partial indexes
**Views Created:** 2 helper views
**Data Loss:** 0 records

---

## Implementation Details

### Soft Delete Columns Added

All child tables now have soft delete support:

1. ✅ **restaurant_locations** (921 records)
   - `deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ`
   - `deleted_by BIGINT` → FK to `admin_users(id)`

2. ✅ **restaurant_contacts** (823 records)
   - `deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ`
   - `deleted_by BIGINT` → FK to `admin_users(id)`

3. ✅ **restaurant_domains** (713 records)
   - `deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ`
   - `deleted_by BIGINT` → FK to `admin_users(id)`

4. ✅ **restaurant_schedules** (1,002 records)
   - `deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ`
   - `deleted_by BIGINT` → FK to `admin_users(id)`

5. ✅ **restaurant_service_configs** (944 records)
   - `deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ`
   - `deleted_by BIGINT` → FK to `admin_users(id)`

---

## Performance Indexes

Partial indexes created for efficient querying of active (non-deleted) records:

1. ✅ `idx_restaurant_locations_deleted`
   - Filters: `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`
   - Type: B-tree on `restaurant_id`

2. ✅ `idx_restaurant_contacts_deleted`
   - Filters: `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`
   - Type: B-tree on `restaurant_id`

3. ✅ `idx_restaurant_domains_deleted`
   - Filters: `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`
   - Type: B-tree on `restaurant_id`

4. ✅ `idx_restaurant_schedules_deleted`
   - Filters: `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`
   - Type: B-tree on `restaurant_id`

5. ✅ `idx_restaurant_service_configs_deleted`
   - Filters: `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`
   - Type: B-tree on `restaurant_id`

**Performance Benefit:** Partial indexes only index non-deleted records, reducing index size and improving query speed.

---

## Helper Views

### 1. v_active_restaurants
**Purpose:** Returns active and pending restaurants (not deleted, not closed)

**Logic:**
```sql
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
  AND status IN ('active', 'pending')
  AND closed_at IS NULL
```

**Current Count:** 314 restaurants

**Use Cases:**
- Display available restaurants to customers
- Admin dashboards showing active restaurants
- Reports on operational restaurant count

---

### 2. v_operational_restaurants
**Purpose:** Returns fully operational restaurants accepting orders

**Logic:**
```sql
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
  AND status = 'active'
  AND closed_at IS NULL
  AND suspended_at IS NULL
```

**Current Count:** 278 restaurants

**Use Cases:**
- Customer-facing restaurant search
- Order placement eligibility check
- Real-time operational status monitoring
- Marketing campaigns (only show orderable restaurants)

## Data Protection Summary

| Table | Total Records | Active Records | Deleted Records | Protection Status |
|-------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| restaurant_locations | 921 | 921 | 0 | ✅ Protected |
| restaurant_contacts | 823 | 823 | 0 | ✅ Protected |
| restaurant_domains | 713 | 713 | 0 | ✅ Protected |
| restaurant_schedules | 1,002 | 1,002 | 0 | ✅ Protected |
| restaurant_service_configs | 944 | 944 | 0 | ✅ Protected |
| **TOTAL** | **4,403** | **4,403** | **0** | **✅ 100%** |

## Benefits of Soft Delete Pattern

### 1. Data Recovery
- Accidental deletions can be undone
- Historical data preserved for auditing
- No permanent data loss

### 2. Audit Trail
- Track who deleted what and when
- `deleted_by` references admin user
- `deleted_at` provides exact timestamp

### 3. GDPR Compliance
- Can mark records as deleted without losing referential integrity
- Allows for data retention policies
- Supports "right to be forgotten" workflows

### 4. Referential Integrity
- Foreign key constraints remain valid
- No orphaned records
- Child records can cascade soft delete from parent

### 5. Performance
- Partial indexes only on active records
- Smaller index size = faster queries
- WHERE clause filters maintain query speed

---

## Usage Examples

### Soft Delete a Restaurant Location
```sql
UPDATE menuca_v3.restaurant_locations
SET deleted_at = NOW(),
    deleted_by = 123  -- admin user ID
WHERE id = 456;
```

### Restore a Soft-Deleted Record
```sql
UPDATE menuca_v3.restaurant_locations
SET deleted_at = NULL,
    deleted_by = NULL
WHERE id = 456;
```

### Query Only Active Locations
```sql
SELECT *
FROM menuca_v3.restaurant_locations
WHERE restaurant_id = 789
  AND deleted_at IS NULL;
```

### Find All Deleted Records (Audit)
```sql
SELECT 
    rl.*,
    au.email as deleted_by_email
FROM menuca_v3.restaurant_locations rl
JOIN menuca_v3.admin_users au ON rl.deleted_by = au.id
WHERE rl.deleted_at IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY rl.deleted_at DESC;
```

### Use Helper Views
```sql
-- Get all operational restaurants
SELECT * FROM menuca_v3.v_operational_restaurants;

-- Get active restaurants (including pending)
SELECT * FROM menuca_v3.v_active_restaurants;
```

### Indexes Created: 5
- 1 partial index per table (B-tree on `restaurant_id` WHERE `deleted_at IS NULL`)

### Views Created: 2
- `v_active_restaurants` (314 rows)
- `v_operational_restaurants` (278 rows)

### Foreign Keys Added: 5
- Each `deleted_by` column → FK to `menuca_v3.admin_users(id)`

## Verification Results

✅ **All soft delete columns exist** (10 columns across 5 tables)
✅ **All partial indexes created** (5 indexes)
✅ **Both helper views functional** (returning correct record counts)
✅ **Zero data loss** (all 4,403 records intact)
✅ **All records currently active** (0 deleted records)
✅ **Foreign key constraints valid** (all `deleted_by` → `admin_users`)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ Soft delete infrastructure complete
2. ⏳ Proceed to Task 1.4: Enforce Status Enum & Add Online/Offline Toggle

### Future Enhancements (Optional)
1. Create soft delete helper functions:
   ```sql
   CREATE FUNCTION soft_delete_location(p_location_id BIGINT, p_admin_id BIGINT);
   CREATE FUNCTION restore_location(p_location_id BIGINT);
   ```

2. Create cascade soft delete trigger:
   ```sql
   -- When restaurant is deleted, soft delete all child records
   CREATE TRIGGER trg_cascade_soft_delete_children
   AFTER UPDATE OF deleted_at ON menuca_v3.restaurants
   FOR EACH ROW
   WHEN (NEW.deleted_at IS NOT NULL AND OLD.deleted_at IS NULL)
   EXECUTE FUNCTION cascade_soft_delete_restaurant_children();
   ```

3. Add soft delete to remaining child tables:
   - `restaurant_special_schedules`
   - `restaurant_time_periods`
   - `admin_user_restaurants`

4. Create admin dashboard view for deleted records:
   ```sql
   CREATE VIEW v_recently_deleted_records AS
   -- Show all soft-deleted records from last 30 days
   ```

---

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

```sql
-- Emergency rollback: Remove soft delete infrastructure
BEGIN;

-- Drop views
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS menuca_v3.v_operational_restaurants;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS menuca_v3.v_active_restaurants;

-- Drop indexes
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS menuca_v3.idx_restaurant_service_configs_deleted;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS menuca_v3.idx_restaurant_schedules_deleted;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS menuca_v3.idx_restaurant_domains_deleted;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS menuca_v3.idx_restaurant_contacts_deleted;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS menuca_v3.idx_restaurant_locations_deleted;

-- Drop columns
ALTER TABLE menuca_v3.restaurant_service_configs
    DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS deleted_at,
    DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS deleted_by;

ALTER TABLE menuca_v3.restaurant_schedules
    DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS deleted_at,
    DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS deleted_by;

ALTER TABLE menuca_v3.restaurant_domains
    DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS deleted_at,
    DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS deleted_by;

ALTER TABLE menuca_v3.restaurant_contacts
    DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS deleted_at,
    DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS deleted_by;

ALTER TABLE menuca_v3.restaurant_locations
    DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS deleted_at,
    DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS deleted_by;

COMMIT;
```

**Rollback Risk:** LOW (no data loss, clean removal)
