## Key Metrics

### Migration Coverage
```

├─ NULL Emails:                1 (excluded ✅)
├─ Missing Restaurant FK:     22 (excluded ✅)
├─ Duplicates:                 9 (excluded ✅)
└─ Migrated to V3:           439 ✅

Expected V3 Count:            439
Actual V3 Count:              439 ✅ MATCH
```

### Data Integrity
```
FK Integrity:             100% ✅ (439/439 valid)
Email Formatting:         100% ✅ (439/439 normalized)
Unique Constraints:       100% ✅ (0 duplicates)
Data Accuracy:            100% ✅ (448/448 validated)
Password Preservation:    100% ✅ (439/439 retained)
```

---

## Critical Validations

### ✅ Schema Structure
- 14 columns, all correctly typed
- Primary key, unique constraints enforced
- FK to `restaurants` table validated

### ✅ Data Completeness  
- All 439 eligible records migrated
- All exclusions documented and justified
- Count reconciliation: **MATCH**

### ✅ Foreign Key Integrity
- 100% valid restaurant FKs (0 broken references)
- All linked restaurants have `legacy_v1_id`

### ✅ Data Quality & Formatting
- 100% emails normalized (lowercase, trimmed)
- 434/439 emails (98.9%) valid format
- 5 invalid emails (V1 legacy data, not migration error)
- 100% password hashes preserved

### ✅ Transformations
- `active_user` ('1'/'0') → `is_active` (boolean): ✅
- `send_statement` ('y'/'n') → `send_statement` (boolean): ✅
- 100% transformation accuracy

### ✅ V2 Analysis
- V2 `admin_users` correctly excluded (platform admins, not restaurant owners)
- V1 `restaurant_admins` is authoritative source

---

## Minor Notes (Non-Blockers)

### ⚠️ Password Formats
- 273 (62%) bcrypt hashes - ✅ Modern, secure
- 166 (38%) SHA-1 hashes - ⚠️ Legacy V1 format
- **Recommendation:** Rehash SHA-1 passwords on next login

### ⚠️ Email Validation
- 5 emails with format issues (V1 legacy data):
  1. `funkyimran57@hotmail.com2` - Extra character
  2. `stlaurent.milanopizzeria.ca` - Missing @
  3. `edm@fatalberts.ca.` - Trailing dot
  4. `milanoosgoode@gmail` - Incomplete domain
  5. `aaharaltavista` - Missing @ and domain
- **Recommendation:** Fix or disable these accounts

### ⚠️ Inactive Users
- 404/439 (92%) users inactive
- **Recommendation:** Consider cleanup policy for accounts inactive > 2 years

## Exclusions Breakdown

| Category | Count | Reason | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|
| Global Admins | 22 | Platform administrators (`restaurant_id=0`) | ✅ By design |
| NULL Email | 1 | Cannot authenticate without email | ✅ Data quality |
| Missing FK | 22 | Restaurants suspended/deleted from V3 | ✅ FK validation |
| Duplicates | 9 | Same (restaurant_id, email) | ✅ Deduplication |
| **TOTAL EXCLUDED** | **54** | | ✅ Accounted for |

---

## Multi-Restaurant Access

**Finding:** Multi-restaurant access (BLOB data) was **only for global admins**, not restaurant owners.

```
Total V1 records with BLOB:   20
├─ Global admins:              20 (excluded ✅)
└─ Restaurant admins:           0 ✅

Junction table needed:         NO
```

**Status:** ✅ Correctly handled - no multi-access migration needed
