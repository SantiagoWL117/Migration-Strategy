## ✅ Migration Success Criteria

### All Criteria Met ✅

- ✅ **444 admin users successfully migrated**
- ✅ **FK integrity maintained** - All restaurant_id values are valid
- ✅ **Unique constraint enforced** - No duplicate (restaurant_id, email) pairs
- ✅ **Data transformations correct** - Boolean conversions, email normalization

- ✅ **All verification checks passed**

---

## 📋 Summary of Exclusions

### By Category:

1. **22 Global Admins** (legacy_v1_restaurant_id = 0)
   - **Reason:** Platform administrators, not restaurant-specific
   - **Action:** Should be migrated separately with global admin system
   - **Examples:** james@menu.ca, linda@menu.ca, stefan@menu.ca

2. **1 NULL Email** (Record ID=58)
   - **Restaurant:** ID 138
   - **User:** Anish, East India Co
   - **Reason:** Cannot authenticate without email address
   - **Action:** No action needed (inactive since 2013)

3. **22 Admin Users for Suspended Restaurants**
   - **Reason:** Associated restaurants deleted from V3 as suspended/closed
   - **Action:** If these restaurants are reactivated later, re-run Step 2 to migrate their admins

4. **9 Duplicate Records**
   - **Reason:** Same (restaurant_id, email) combination in V1
   - **Action:** Kept record with most recent `last_login`

## 🔍 Validation Queries

### Verify migration count
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS migrated_users
FROM menuca_v3.restaurant_admin_users;
-- Expected: 444
```

### Check distribution
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS total,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_active = true) AS active,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_active = false) AS inactive,
  COUNT(DISTINCT restaurant_id) AS unique_restaurants
FROM menuca_v3.restaurant_admin_users;
```

### View sample migrated users
```sql
SELECT 
  au.first_name || ' ' || au.last_name AS full_name,
  au.email,
  au.is_active,
  au.last_login,
  r.name AS restaurant_name
FROM menuca_v3.restaurant_admin_users au
JOIN menuca_v3.restaurants r ON r.id = au.restaurant_id
ORDER BY au.last_login DESC NULLS LAST
LIMIT 20;
```

### Check for any remaining issues
```sql
-- Should return 0 orphaned accounts
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM menuca_v3.restaurant_admin_users au
LEFT JOIN menuca_v3.restaurants r ON r.id = au.restaurant_id
WHERE r.id IS NULL;
```

## ⏭️ Next Steps (Optional)

### Step 5: Multi-Restaurant Access Migration (NOT RUN)

**Status:** ⏸️ **Skipped for now** (per user request)

This step would migrate the V1 `allowed_restaurants` BLOB data to enable multi-restaurant access functionality.

**When to run Step 5:**
- When you need multi-restaurant access functionality
- After creating `menuca_v3.restaurant_admin_access` junction table
- Follow the guide in `BLOB_DECODING_SOLUTIONS.md`
