# Restaurant Domains Migration - Fix Applied Summary

## ✅ Fix 2 Applied: V1 Upsert Idempotency

**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**  
**Type:** Preventive maintenance (migration logic improvement)

---

## 📋 What Was Done

### File Modified
**Document:** `documentation/Restaurants/restaurant_domains_migration_plan.md`  
**Line Changed:** 141 → 146 (with added documentation)

### The Change

#### Before (Original - Line 141):
```sql
ON CONFLICT (restaurant_id, lower(domain)) DO UPDATE
SET is_enabled  = EXCLUDED.is_enabled,
    domain_type = COALESCE(menuca_v3.restaurant_domains.domain_type, EXCLUDED.domain_type),
    ...
```

#### After (Fixed - Line 146):
```sql
ON CONFLICT (restaurant_id, lower(domain)) DO UPDATE
SET 
    -- ✅ FIXED (2025-10-02): Preserve existing is_enabled to prevent V1 from re-enabling V2-disabled domains
    -- CRITICAL: Use COALESCE to preserve existing is_enabled status (idempotency fix)
    -- Previous: is_enabled = EXCLUDED.is_enabled (would overwrite V2's FALSE with V1's TRUE)
    -- Fixed: is_enabled = COALESCE(existing, new) (preserves V2's decisions)
    is_enabled  = COALESCE(menuca_v3.restaurant_domains.is_enabled, EXCLUDED.is_enabled),
    domain_type = COALESCE(menuca_v3.restaurant_domains.domain_type, EXCLUDED.domain_type),
    ...
```

#### Also Updated (Line 152):
```sql
WHERE menuca_v3.restaurant_domains.is_enabled IS DISTINCT FROM COALESCE(menuca_v3.restaurant_domains.is_enabled, EXCLUDED.is_enabled)
```

## 🎯 Why This Fix Was Needed

### The Problem
Without this fix, re-running the V1 migration could:
- ❌ Re-enable domains that administrators disabled in V2
- ❌ Overwrite business decisions (domain closures, redirects)
- ❌ Break idempotency (unsafe to re-run migration)
- ❌ Cause customer confusion (old domains coming back online)

### The Solution
With COALESCE logic:
- ✅ Existing `is_enabled` values are preserved
- ✅ V2 admin decisions remain intact
- ✅ Migration is fully idempotent
- ✅ Safe to re-run in CI/CD pipelines

---

## 📊 Impact Assessment

### Current Database State
**No changes to existing data** - The fix is preventive:
- 722 domains remain unchanged
- 699 enabled domains still enabled ✅
- 23 disabled domains still disabled ✅
- 0 data corruption occurred ✅

### Future Protection
**Prevents issues on re-run:**
- ✅ V1 migration can be re-executed safely
- ✅ Automated CI/CD pipelines won't corrupt data
- ✅ Database refreshes won't lose admin decisions
- ✅ Team members can troubleshoot without risk

---

## 🔍 Verification

### How to Verify the Fix Works

Run this query after any future V1 migration re-run:

```sql
-- Verify no disabled V2 domains were re-enabled
WITH v2_disabled AS (
  SELECT 
    r.id AS v3_restaurant_id,
    lower(
      regexp_replace(
        regexp_replace(trim(COALESCE(d.domain,'')), '^https?://', '', 'i'),
        '^www\.|/$', '', 'i'
      )
    ) AS domain_norm
  FROM staging.v2_restaurants_domain d
  JOIN menuca_v3.restaurants r ON r.legacy_v2_id = d.restaurant_id
  WHERE COALESCE(trim(d.domain),'') <> ''
    AND lower(d.enabled) = 'n'
)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS v2_disabled_incorrectly_enabled
FROM v2_disabled v2
JOIN menuca_v3.restaurant_domains v3 
  ON v3.restaurant_id = v2.v3_restaurant_id 
  AND lower(v3.domain) = v2.domain_norm
WHERE v3.is_enabled IS NOT FALSE;

-- Expected Result: 0 rows (all 23 disabled domains stay disabled)
```

## 🚦 What's Next

### Remaining Action (Fix 1)
**Still pending:** Invalid domain format fix

```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
-- File: fix_invalid_domain_format.sql

UPDATE menuca_v3.restaurant_domains
SET domain = 'phovanvan.menu.ca', updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = 2659 AND domain = '!phovanvan.menu.ca';
```

**Impact:** 1 domain (Restaurant 605) will be corrected  
**Time:** 30 seconds  
**Risk:** Very low (single record, specific WHERE clause)

## 💡 Key Takeaways

### What We Learned
1. **Idempotency matters** - Migrations should be safe to re-run
2. **V2 takes precedence** - Newer data should override older data
3. **COALESCE is powerful** - Simple pattern prevents complex bugs
4. **Preventive fixes save time** - Better to fix before production issues occur

### Best Practices Applied
- ✅ Added detailed inline comments for future maintainers
- ✅ Updated all related documentation
- ✅ Created verification queries for testing
- ✅ Preserved backward compatibility
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing data
