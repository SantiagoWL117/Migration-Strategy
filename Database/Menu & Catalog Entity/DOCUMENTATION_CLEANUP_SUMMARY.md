- ✅ Technical highlights (JSONB structures, indexes)
- ✅ Scripts and tools created
- ✅ Data quality decisions and exclusions
- ✅ Success metrics and lessons learned
- ✅ CSV file inventory
- ✅ Migration timeline and status

**Use Cases**:
- Understanding the migration approach
- Recreating similar migrations
- Troubleshooting issues
- Auditing data lineage
- Onboarding technical team members

---

### 2. BUSINESS_RULES.md (How it's designed)

**Purpose**: Business logic guide for developers and AI agents

**Contents**:
- ✅ Entity overview and data model
- ✅ Schema structure with relationships
- ✅ Dishes & pricing model
- ✅ Dish modifiers system (contextual pricing)
- ✅ Ingredient groups system (many-to-many)
- ✅ Combo groups system (meal deals)
- ✅ Query patterns and examples
- ✅ Business constraints and validation rules
- ✅ Source tracking guidelines

**Use Cases**:
- Understanding menu structure
- Writing queries against V3

## Benefits of Cleanup

### Before (26 files)
- ❌ Information fragmented across 26 documents
- ❌ Duplicate information in multiple files
- ❌ Mix of temporary and permanent documentation
- ❌ Hard to find authoritative information
- ❌ No clear "source of truth"
- ❌ Historical analysis buried in docs

### After (2 files)
- ✅ All information in 2 clear sources
- ✅ No duplication - single source per topic
- ✅ Only permanent, authoritative documentation
- ✅ Easy to find information
- ✅ Clear sources of truth defined
- ✅ Historical details removed or consolidated

---

## What Was Preserved

1. **Migration Process** → MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md
   - All phases (1-8) documented
   - BLOB solutions explained
   - Data exclusions documented
   - Final counts and statistics

2. **Business Logic** → BUSINESS_RULES.md
   - Complete entity design
   - All business rules preserved
   - Query patterns documented
   - Validation rules included

3. **Technical Details**
   - CSV file inventory preserved
   - Script documentation intact
   - Schema changes documented
   - Optimization decisions recorded

## For Future Developers

### "Where do I find...?"

**Migration technical details?**
→ `documentation/Menu & Catalog/MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md`

**Business rules and entity design?**
→ `documentation/Menu & Catalog/BUSINESS_RULES.md`

**CSV data files?**
→ `Database/Menu & Catalog Entity/CSV/`

**Original MySQL dumps?**
→ `Database/Menu & Catalog Entity/dumps/`

**Python deserialization scripts?**
→ `Database/Menu & Catalog Entity/scripts/`

**Reference SQL queries?**
→ `Database/Menu & Catalog Entity/queries/`

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Adding New Information

**Migration-related** (how it was done):
- Add to `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md`
- Update phase sections if needed
- Keep chronological order

**Business logic** (how it's designed):
- Add to `BUSINESS_RULES.md`
- Update relevant entity sections
- Add query examples if applicable

### Avoid Creating

- ❌ Temporary analysis documents
- ❌ Status update files
- ❌ Issue tracking files
- ❌ Planning documents

**Instead**: Update the 2 sources of truth directly.
