# V1 Menu Data Reload Status - October 10, 2025

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### 1. Root Cause Analysis
**Problem:** Combo migration failing with 92.81% orphan rate

**Cause:** The `menuca_v1_menu.sql` dump file has been pre-filtered:
- Original V1 table: ~58,057 rows
- Current dump: 14,884 rows (25.6% of original)
- **Excluded:** 43,173 rows (74.4%) - hidden dishes, blank names, inactive items

**Impact:** Combos reference dishes by ID, including the "excluded" items used as modifiers/toppings

---

### 2. Immediate Workaround Created

**Table Created:** `staging.menuca_v1_menu_full`

```sql
-- Combined menu + ingredients for better coverage
SELECT * FROM staging.menuca_v1_menu         -- 14,884 rows
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM staging.menuca_v1_ingredients  -- 43,930 rows
```

**Result:** 58,814 total rows

**Coverage Achieved:**
- Combo dishes found: 2,108 out of 5,777 (36.49%)
- **Still missing: 3,669 dish IDs (63.51%)**

---

### 3. Documentation Created

**For Santiago:**
- `MISSING_COMBO_DISHES_FOR_SANTIAGO.md` - Complete data request with examples
- Lists the exact 3,669 missing dish IDs needed
- Provides SQL queries to extract from source database

**Updated:**
- `04_STAGING_COMBOS_BLOCKED.md` - Current status and progress
- Documented partial solution and remaining blockers

---

## ‚è≥ Waiting For

### Santiago to Provide One of:

**Option 1: Full Unfiltered Menu Dump** (Preferred)
```sql
-- From menuca_v1 MySQL database
SELECT * FROM menu 
-- NO WHERE clause - export everything including hidden/blank items
ORDER BY id;
```
Expected: ~58,057 rows (or at least the 3,669 missing dish IDs)

**Option 2: Database Access Credentials**
- I can query the source database directly
- Extract only the 3,669 missing dishes
- Fast targeted solution

**Option 3: Targeted Export**
```sql
SELECT * FROM menu 
WHERE id IN (4150,4151,4152,...) -- list of 3,669 IDs
```

| Combo dishes found | 2,108 | ‚ö†Ô∏è 36.49% |
| Combo dishes missing | 3,669 | ‚ùå 63.51% |

## üéØ Next Steps

### When Data Arrives:

1. **Load missing 3,669 dishes** into `staging.menuca_v1_menu_full`
2. **Re-validate coverage** (should reach 95%+)
3. **Resume Ticket 04** - Run combo migration script
4. **Verify orphan rate** drops below 5%
5. **Continue to Ticket 05** - Staging validation
6. **Deploy to production** - Tickets 06-10

### Expected Timeline:
- Data load: ~15 minutes
- Validation: ~10 minutes
- Combo migration: ~20 minutes
- **Total: ~45 minutes** from data receipt to unblocking

## üí° Key Insight

The "missing" dishes aren't actually missing - they were intentionally filtered out during an earlier data cleaning phase because they had:
- Blank names
- `showinmenu='N'` flag
- Were from inactive restaurants

However, **combos need these dishes** because they're used as:
- Pizza toppings (hidden modifiers)
- Side dish options
- Drink choices
- Add-on items
- Customization options

This is why the combo system can't work with only the "visible" menu items.
