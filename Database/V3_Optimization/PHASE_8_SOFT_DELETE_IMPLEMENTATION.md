# Phase 8: Soft Delete Infrastructure - Implementation Report

**Executed:** October 15, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Execution Time:** ~3 minutes  
**Risk Level:** 🟢 LOW (additive only, non-breaking)

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

Add soft delete capability to key menuca_v3 tables for:
- **Audit trail** (who deleted what, when)
- **Data recovery** (restore accidentally deleted records)
- **GDPR compliance** (user account deletion with history)

---

## ✅ **What Was Implemented**

### **1. Soft Delete Columns Added (5 Priority Tables)**

| Table | Rows | Columns Added | Purpose |
|-------|------|--------------|---------|
| `users` | 32,349 | `deleted_at`, `deleted_by` | GDPR compliance, user account deletion |
| `restaurants` | 944 | `deleted_at`, `deleted_by` | Permanent closure (separate from `suspended_at`) |
| `dishes` | 15,740 | `deleted_at`, `deleted_by` | Menu history with audit trail |
| `promotional_coupons` | 581 | `deleted_at`, `deleted_by` | Fraud prevention, auditing |
| `admin_users` | 456 | `deleted_at`, `deleted_by` | Access revocation with accountability |

**Total Records Protected:** 49,970 rows

#### **Column Specifications:**
- **`deleted_at`**: `TIMESTAMPTZ NULL` - Soft delete timestamp (NULL = active)
- **`deleted_by`**: `BIGINT NULL` - References `admin_users(id)` for accountability

---

### **2. Partial Indexes Created (Performance Optimization)**

5 partial indexes created to optimize queries for active (non-deleted) records:

```sql
-- Example: Only indexes rows where deleted_at IS NULL
CREATE INDEX idx_users_deleted_at 
  ON menuca_v3.users(deleted_at) 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
```

| Index Name | Table | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `idx_users_deleted_at` | `users` | Fast filtering of active users |
| `idx_restaurants_deleted_at` | `restaurants` | Fast filtering of active restaurants |
| `idx_dishes_deleted_at` | `dishes` | Fast filtering of active dishes |
| `idx_promotional_coupons_deleted_at` | `promotional_coupons` | Fast filtering of active coupons |
| `idx_admin_users_deleted_at` | `admin_users` | Fast filtering of active admins |

**Performance Impact:** Minimal storage overhead, significant query speedup for active record filtering.

---

### **3. Helper Views Created (Developer Experience)**

5 convenience views created for easy querying of active records:

| View Name | Filter Logic | Records |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `active_users` | `deleted_at IS NULL` | 32,349 |
| `active_restaurants` | `deleted_at IS NULL AND status IN ('active', 'pending')` | 295 |
| `active_dishes` | `deleted_at IS NULL AND is_active = true` | 15,684 |
| `active_promotional_coupons` | `deleted_at IS NULL AND is_active = true` | 573 |
| `active_admin_users` | `deleted_at IS NULL` | 456 |

#### **View Usage Example:**

```sql
-- Instead of:
SELECT * FROM menuca_v3.users WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Use:
SELECT * FROM menuca_v3.active_users;
```

CREATE INDEX idx_users_deleted_at ON menuca_v3.users USING btree (deleted_at) WHERE (deleted_at IS NULL)
```

### **3. View Verification: ✅ PASS**

All 5 helper views created and functional:

| View | Total Records | Active Records | Deleted Records | Status |

## 🎨 **Design Decisions**

### **1. Hybrid Soft Delete Strategy**

We implemented a **multi-layered approach** respecting existing patterns:

#### **Layer 1: `is_active` Boolean (Visibility Toggle)**
- **Purpose:** Temporary visibility control (e.g., out of stock, seasonal)
- **Example:** `dishes.is_active = false` → temporarily hide from menu
- **Behavior:** Can be toggled frequently

#### **Layer 2: `suspended_at` Timestamp (Temporary Administrative Action)**
- **Purpose:** Temporary suspension with potential recovery
- **Example:** `restaurants.suspended_at` → restaurant temporarily suspended for policy violation
- **Behavior:** Audit trail for suspension period

#### **Layer 3: `deleted_at` + `deleted_by` (Permanent Logical Deletion)**
- **Purpose:** GDPR compliance, permanent closure, data retention
- **Example:** `users.deleted_at` → user requested account deletion
- **Behavior:** Audit trail with accountability

### **2. Why Not Replace Existing Patterns?**

**Decision:** Extend, don't replace.

**Rationale:**
- ✅ **Backward compatibility:** Existing application code continues working
- ✅ **Semantic clarity:** Each layer has distinct business meaning
- ✅ **Zero risk:** Additive changes only (no breaking changes)

### **3. Foreign Key Reference Choice**

**All `deleted_by` columns reference `admin_users.id` (not `auth.users.id`)**

**Rationale:**
- ✅ Most deletions are administrative actions
- ✅ Consistent with existing `created_by`, `updated_by` patterns
- ✅ Vendor deletions also tracked (vendors have admin user references)

---

## 📖 **Usage Examples**

### **Example 1: Soft Delete a User (GDPR Compliance)**

```sql
-- Mark user as deleted
UPDATE menuca_v3.users
SET 
  deleted_at = NOW(),
  deleted_by = 123  -- admin user ID who performed deletion
WHERE id = 456;

-- Verify user is excluded from active_users view
SELECT * FROM menuca_v3.active_users WHERE id = 456;  -- Returns 0 rows
```

### **Example 2: Soft Delete a Restaurant (Permanent Closure)**

```sql
-- Mark restaurant as permanently closed
UPDATE menuca_v3.restaurants
SET 
  deleted_at = NOW(),
  deleted_by = 123,
  status = 'closed'
WHERE id = 789;
```

### **Example 3: Restore a Soft-Deleted Dish**

```sql
-- Restore accidentally deleted dish
UPDATE menuca_v3.dishes
SET 
  deleted_at = NULL,
  deleted_by = NULL
WHERE id = 1000;
```

### **Example 4: Query Deleted Records (Audit Report)**

```sql
-- Get all users deleted in the last 30 days
SELECT 
  u.id,
  u.email,
  u.deleted_at,
  a.email AS deleted_by_admin
FROM menuca_v3.users u
LEFT JOIN menuca_v3.admin_users a ON u.deleted_by = a.id
WHERE u.deleted_at IS NOT NULL
  AND u.deleted_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
ORDER BY u.deleted_at DESC;
```

### **Example 5: Application Code Integration**

```javascript
// Instead of DELETE (destructive)
const deleteUser = async (userId, adminId) => {
  return supabase
    .from('users')
    .update({ 
      deleted_at: new Date().toISOString(),
      deleted_by: adminId 
    })
    .eq('id', userId);
};

// Query active users (using view)
const getActiveUsers = async () => {
  return supabase
    .from('active_users')  // Uses helper view
    .select('*');
};

// Or manually filter
const getActiveUsersManual = async () => {
  return supabase
    .from('users')
    .select('*')
    .is('deleted_at', null);  // Filter out deleted
};
```

## 🚀 **Performance Impact**

### **Storage Overhead:**
- **2 new columns per table** × 5 tables = 10 new columns
- **Column size:** 8 bytes (TIMESTAMPTZ) + 8 bytes (BIGINT) = 16 bytes per row
- **Total overhead:** ~800 KB (49,970 rows × 16 bytes)
- **Impact:** ✅ **NEGLIGIBLE** (<0.1% of database size)

### **Query Performance:**
- **Partial indexes:** Only index active rows (WHERE deleted_at IS NULL)
- **Index size:** Minimal (only active records indexed)
- **Query speed:** ✅ **IMPROVED** (indexes enable fast active record filtering)

### **Write Performance:**
- **Impact:** ✅ **MINIMAL** (2 NULL values inserted per new record)
- **Soft delete operation:** Fast UPDATE (no cascade deletes needed)

---

## 🔄 **Rollback Plan**

If rollback is needed (unlikely):

```sql
-- Step 1: Drop views
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS menuca_v3.active_users CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS menuca_v3.active_restaurants CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS menuca_v3.active_dishes CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS menuca_v3.active_promotional_coupons CASCADE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS menuca_v3.active_admin_users CASCADE;

-- Step 2: Drop indexes
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS menuca_v3.idx_users_deleted_at;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS menuca_v3.idx_restaurants_deleted_at;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS menuca_v3.idx_dishes_deleted_at;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS menuca_v3.idx_promotional_coupons_deleted_at;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS menuca_v3.idx_admin_users_deleted_at;

-- Step 3: Drop columns
ALTER TABLE menuca_v3.users DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS deleted_at, DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS deleted_by;
ALTER TABLE menuca_v3.restaurants DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS deleted_at, DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS deleted_by;
ALTER TABLE menuca_v3.dishes DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS deleted_at, DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS deleted_by;
ALTER TABLE menuca_v3.promotional_coupons DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS deleted_at, DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS deleted_by;
ALTER TABLE menuca_v3.admin_users DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS deleted_at, DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS deleted_by;
```

**Rollback Risk:** 🟢 **LOW** (no data loss, no FK violations)

## 📝 **Next Steps**

### **1. Application Integration (Optional - Future Work)**

Update application code to:
- Use `active_*` views instead of base tables
- Implement soft delete instead of hard delete
- Add "restore deleted item" functionality

### **2. Data Retention Policy (Optional - Future Work)**

Consider implementing automatic cleanup of old soft-deleted records:

```sql
-- Example: Auto-delete users soft-deleted >2 years ago (GDPR compliance)
DELETE FROM menuca_v3.users
WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL
  AND deleted_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '2 years';
```

### **3. Extend to Additional Tables (Optional - Future Work)**

Consider adding soft delete to:
- `courses` (1,207 rows) - Menu category history
- `ingredients` (31,542 rows) - Modifier history
- `combo_groups` (8,234 rows) - Combo meal history
