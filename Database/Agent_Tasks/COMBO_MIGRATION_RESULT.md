# 🚀 Combo Migration Execution Report

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Executed By:** Claude  
**Status:** ⚠️ **PARTIAL SUCCESS - Requires Additional Data Migration**

---

## ✅ What Worked

### Data Load Success
- ✅ staging.menuca_v1_menu_full loaded (62,482 rows)
- ✅ staging.menuca_v1_combos loaded (16,461 combo relationships)
- ✅ Combo dish coverage in staging: 99.98% (5,776 of 5,777)

### Migration Execution
- ✅ Transaction executed successfully
- ✅ 1,219 combo_items created
- ✅ 634 combo_groups now have items (7.7% of total)

---

## ⚠️ The Problem

**Orphan Rate:** 92.30% (7,600 of 8,234 groups still orphaned)

**Root Cause:** Only 420 of 5,777 required dishes exist in `menuca_v3.dishes` with `legacy_v1_id` populated.

## 🔍 Detailed Analysis

### Mapping Statistics

| Check | Count | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| V1 Combos in Staging | 16,461 | ✅ |
| V1 Groups with V3 Mapping | 6,894 | ✅ |
| V1 Dishes with V3 Mapping | **420** | ❌ (Need 5,777) |
| Combos with BOTH Mappings | 1,156 | ⚠️ (7% of total) |

### What's Missing?

The unmapped dishes are **toppings, modifiers, and ingredients** that combos reference:

```
Examples of Missing Dishes:
- BBQ Chips (Restaurant 118)
- Lettuce (Restaurant 94)
- Mayo (Restaurant 94)
- Pineapple (Restaurant 125)
- Green Peppers (Restaurant 125)
- Onions (Restaurant 125)
- Ground Beef (Restaurant 125)
- Combination dishes (Restaurant 79)
```

These dishes exist in:
- ✅ `staging.menuca_v1_menu_full` (loaded today)
- ❌ `menuca_v3.dishes` (NOT migrated)

---

## 📊 Current State

### Before Migration
- Combo Groups: 8,234
- Combo Items: 0
- Orphaned Groups: 8,234 (100%)

### After Migration Attempt
- Combo Groups: 8,234
- Combo Items: 1,219
- Groups with Items: 634 (7.7%)
- Orphaned Groups: 7,600 (92.30%)

## 🎯 What Needs to Happen Next

### Option 1: Migrate Missing Dishes (RECOMMENDED)

**Task:** Migrate the 5,357 missing dishes from V1 to V3

1. Identify which dishes in `staging.menuca_v1_menu_full` are referenced by combos but don't exist in `menuca_v3.dishes`
2. Migrate these dishes to `menuca_v3.dishes` with proper `legacy_v1_id` mapping
3. Re-run combo migration (will automatically pick up new dishes)

**Expected Result:**
- Orphan rate: < 1%
- Combo items created: ~16,000
- All combos functional

### Option 2: Alternative Mapping Strategy

Map combos to dishes using name + restaurant matching instead of legacy_v1_id:
- ⚠️ Risk: Name collisions
- ⚠️ Risk: Encoding issues (French characters)
- ⚠️ Not recommended

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### What We Tried

1. ✅ Loaded missing V1 menu data (3,668 dishes)
2. ✅ Achieved 99.98% combo dish coverage in staging
3. ✅ Executed combo migration with proper type casting
4. ⚠️ Discovered dishes table missing most combo references

### SQL That Worked

```sql
INSERT INTO menuca_v3.combo_items (
  combo_group_id, dish_id, quantity, is_required, 
  display_order, source_system, source_id, created_at
)
SELECT DISTINCT
  cg.id, d.id, 1, true,
  COALESCE(vc."order"::integer, 0),
  'v1', vc.id::bigint, NOW()
FROM staging.menuca_v1_combos vc
JOIN menuca_v3.combo_groups cg ON cg.legacy_v1_id = vc."group"::integer
JOIN menuca_v3.dishes d ON d.legacy_v1_id = vc.dish::integer
WHERE cg.id IS NOT NULL AND d.id IS NOT NULL;
```

### Why It Only Worked Partially

The `JOIN menuca_v3.dishes d ON d.legacy_v1_id = vc.dish::integer` only found 420 dishes.

**Missing:** 5,357 dishes that are toppings/modifiers/options

---

## 📋 Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Tonight/Tomorrow Morning)

1. **Create Missing Dishes Migration**
   - Query to identify missing dishes
   - Migration script to insert into menuca_v3.dishes
   - Preserve legacy_v1_id for mapping

2. **Re-run Combo Migration**
   - Use same SQL script
   - Will automatically pick up new dishes
   - Expected: ~15,000 more combo_items

### Validation After Completion

```sql
-- Should show < 1% orphan rate
WITH group_stats AS (
  SELECT cg.id, COUNT(ci.id) as item_count
  FROM menuca_v3.combo_groups cg
  LEFT JOIN menuca_v3.combo_items ci ON cg.id = ci.combo_group_id
  GROUP BY cg.id
)
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_groups,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN item_count = 0 THEN 1 END) as orphaned,
  ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN item_count = 0 THEN 1 END)::numeric / COUNT(*)::numeric * 100, 2) as orphan_pct
FROM group_stats;
```

## ✅ Positive Outcomes

Despite the partial success:

1. ✅ Migration SQL script works correctly
2. ✅ Transaction safety confirmed (auto-rollback on errors)
3. ✅ Root cause identified precisely
4. ✅ Clear path forward established
5. ✅ 634 combo groups now functional (better than 16 before!)

## 🚗 Drive Home Safely!

**Brian:** The good news is we know exactly what needs to happen next. The combo migration script works - we just need to migrate the missing dishes first, then re-run it.

**Tomorrow's Task:**
- Create and execute missing dishes migration
- Re-run combo migration
- Achieve < 1% orphan rate target

**Time Estimate:** 1-2 hours

## 📊 Files Updated

- ✅ `COMBO_MIGRATION_RESULT.md` (this file)
- ✅ `DATA_LOAD_SUCCESS.md` (V1 data load complete)
- ✅ `04_STAGING_COMBOS_BLOCKED.md` (updated status)

---

**Status:** Transaction committed, but incomplete. Need dish migration before re-running.

**Next Agent Task:** Create missing dishes migration script.
