- Batch 3C (241-264): 21 deals
- Run final verification

**Time Estimate:** 10-15 minutes

### Option 2: Generate Complete SQL File
Create one comprehensive SQL file with all remaining 101 UPDATE statements and execute via user's preferred method.

**Time Estimate:** 5 minutes to generate, user execution time varies
