## Execution Strategy

Due to response size limits, continuing with systematic batch execution:

1. **Execute Batch 2:** 70 deals in 2-3 sub-batches
2. **Fetch + Execute Batch 3:** Final 93 deals  
3. **Full Verification:** Confirm all 194 deals processed

## Next Steps

Continue automated batch processing. ETA: 15-20 minutes for complete deserialization of all 194 deals.

**All infrastructure is built, tested, and working perfectly. Just need execution time.**
