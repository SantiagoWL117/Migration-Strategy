# Admin Consolidation - QUICK START ⚡

**For:** Brian + Santiago  
**Time to Execute:** 30 minutes  
**Risk Level:** 🟢 LOW (No impact on restaurants table)

---

## 🎯 What This Does

**Consolidates 3 admin tables → 2 tables**

```
BEFORE:                          AFTER:
admin_users (51)                 admin_users (490)
restaurant_admin_users (439)  →  admin_user_restaurants (533+)
admin_user_restaurants (94)      [restaurant_admin_users archived]
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Eliminates 8 duplicate emails
- ✅ Removes unused permissions columns (0% usage)
- ✅ Single source of truth for admins
- ✅ Faster queries (fewer joins)

---

## ⚡ 5-Minute Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Connect to Database
```bash
# Connect to Supabase via MCP or psql
# Make sure you're on the RIGHT database!
```

### 2️⃣ Test Migration (SAFE - Nothing Committed)
```sql
-- Run with default ROLLBACK (safe test)
\i Database/Admin_Consolidation/02_ADMIN_CONSOLIDATION_MIGRATION.sql
```

**Watch for:**
- ✅ All steps complete without errors
- ✅ Final counts look correct
- ✅ Validation checks PASS

### 3️⃣ Validate Results
```sql
-- Run all validation queries
\i Database/Admin_Consolidation/03_VALIDATION_QUERIES.sql
```

**Verify:**
- ✅ 100% migration rate
- ✅ 0 duplicate emails in unified system
- ✅ 533+ restaurant assignments
- ✅ Permissions columns dropped

### 4️⃣ Execute for Real
```sql
-- Edit migration script:
-- Change line 346: ROLLBACK; → COMMIT;

-- Run again
\i Database/Admin_Consolidation/02_ADMIN_CONSOLIDATION_MIGRATION.sql
```

### 5️⃣ Final Validation
```sql
-- Run validation queries again
\i Database/Admin_Consolidation/03_VALIDATION_QUERIES.sql

-- Test application login
-- Verify restaurant access
```

## 📊 Expected Results

### Database Counts
| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| admin_users | 51 | ~480 | +429 |

| admin_user_restaurants | 94 | 533+ | +439 |
| Duplicate emails | 8 | 0 | -8 ✅ |
| Unused permissions | 2 cols | 0 cols | -2 ✅ |

*\*Still exists but migrated to new system*

### Validation Checks (All Must Pass)
- ✅ Check 1: Overall counts correct
- ✅ Check 2: 100% migration rate
- ✅ Check 3: 8 duplicates resolved
- ✅ Check 4: 0 duplicate emails in admin_users
- ✅ Check 5: 533+ restaurant assignments
- ✅ Check 6: 0 admins without migration
- ✅ Check 7: 0 admins without restaurant access
- ✅ Check 8: Permissions columns dropped
- ✅ Check 9: Migration summary exists
- ✅ Check 10: Sample migrated users visible

## 🚨 Rollback (If Needed)

### If Still Testing
```sql
-- Migration already defaults to ROLLBACK
-- Nothing committed, nothing to undo
```

### If Already Committed
```sql
-- Run rollback script
\i Database/Admin_Consolidation/04_ROLLBACK.sql

-- Change ROLLBACK → COMMIT at bottom
-- Run again to apply
```
