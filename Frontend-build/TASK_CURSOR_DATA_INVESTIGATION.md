# TASK FOR CURSOR AGENT: Prima Pizza Data Investigation

**Priority:** ðŸ”´ CRITICAL
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours
**Agent:** Cursor (Backend/SQL Expert)
**Context:** See `/Frontend-build/DATA_DISCREPANCY_PRIMA_PIZZA.md`

---

## OBJECTIVE

Determine why Prima Pizza's menu in menuca_v3 doesn't match their live site (https://m.primapizza.ca/menu) and identify the source of truth for restaurant menu data.

---

## YOUR TASKS

### Task 1: Check V1 Database
**Query Prima Pizza data from menuca_v1 schema (legacy_v1_id: 1069):**

```sql
-- Check if menuca_v1 schema exists
SELECT schema_name FROM information_schema.schemata WHERE schema_name = 'menuca_v1';

-- If exists, query Prima Pizza dishes
SELECT
  id,
  name,
  price,
  description,
  category_id,
  created_at,
  updated_at
FROM menuca_v1.dishes
WHERE restaurant_id = 1069
ORDER BY name
LIMIT 50;

-- Check categories
SELECT * FROM menuca_v1.categories WHERE restaurant_id = 1069;
```

**Compare with live site items:**
- "Small Pizza 3 Toppings" - $11.00
- "XL Pepperoni Pizza" - $24.00
- "Mega Meal" - $59.99
- "Mozzarella Sticks (6 pieces)" - $10.99
- "Greek Salad" - $6.99

**Document:** Does V1 have current accurate data? Or is it also outdated?

---

### Task 2: Check V2 Database (if exists)
```sql
-- Check if menuca_v2 schema exists
SELECT schema_name FROM information_schema.schemata WHERE schema_name = 'menuca_v2';

-- If exists, find Prima Pizza (need to find V2 ID)
SELECT * FROM menuca_v2.restaurants WHERE name ILIKE '%prima%pizza%';

-- Query dishes
SELECT * FROM menuca_v2.dishes WHERE restaurant_id = [v2_id];
```

**Document:** Does V2 exist? Does it have Prima Pizza? Is data current?

---

### Task 3: Analyze V1 â†’ V3 Migration
**Check when V3 data was created:**
```sql
SELECT
  MIN(created_at) as first_dish_migrated,
  MAX(updated_at) as last_dish_updated,
  COUNT(*) as total_dishes,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN base_price IS NULL THEN 1 END) as dishes_without_price,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN course_id IS NULL THEN 1 END) as dishes_without_category
FROM menuca_v3.dishes
WHERE restaurant_id = 824;
```

**Look for migration logs/scripts:**
- Check `/supabase/migrations/` for V1 â†’ V3 migration scripts
- Look for date stamps matching October 2025
- Find script that populated Prima Pizza data

**Document:** When was data migrated? What was the source? Why no categories?

---

### Task 4: Check All Restaurants Pattern
**Sample query to see if this is widespread:**
```sql
-- Find restaurants with no categories in V3
SELECT
  r.id,
  r.name,
  r.slug,
  COUNT(d.id) as dish_count,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN d.course_id IS NULL THEN 1 END) as uncategorized_dishes,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN d.base_price IS NULL THEN 1 END) as dishes_no_price
FROM menuca_v3.restaurants r
LEFT JOIN menuca_v3.dishes d ON d.restaurant_id = r.id AND d.deleted_at IS NULL
WHERE r.status = 'active'
  AND r.online_ordering_enabled = true
GROUP BY r.id, r.name, r.slug
HAVING COUNT(d.id) > 0
ORDER BY dish_count DESC
LIMIT 30;
```

**Document:** Is this a Prima Pizza issue or system-wide problem?

---

### Task 5: Propose Solution

Based on your findings, recommend ONE of these approaches:

**Option A: Re-export from V1**
- If V1 has current data, re-run migration with updated export
- Include categories and fix NULL prices

**Option B: Sync from V2**
- If V2 exists and has current data, migrate from V2 instead
- May need new migration script

**Option C: Build Live Site Scraper**
- If neither V1 nor V2 has current data
- Need to scrape from live restaurant sites
- Most complex but gets true current state

**Option D: Manual Update**
- Restaurant owners manually update their menus in V3
- Admin interface needed
- Time-consuming but ensures accuracy

---

## DELIVERABLES

Create a file: `/Frontend-build/CURSOR_FINDINGS_DATA_INVESTIGATION.md`

Include:
1. âœ… V1 database findings (exists? has Prima? data current?)
2. âœ… V2 database findings (exists? has Prima? data current?)
3. âœ… Migration analysis (when? from where? why incomplete?)
4. âœ… Pattern analysis (1 restaurant or many?)
5. âœ… Recommended solution with justification
6. âœ… SQL scripts needed to implement solution

---

## NOTES

- Use Supabase MCP for all database queries
- Save important query results in your findings document
- If you find migration scripts, include relevant snippets
- Be thorough - this blocks frontend development
