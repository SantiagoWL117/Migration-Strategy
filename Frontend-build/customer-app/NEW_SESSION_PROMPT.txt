Hi! I'm continuing work on the Menu.ca AI search feature. Please read HANDOFF.md for full context.

TL;DR:
- AI search is working with real cuisine data
- Using placeholder values for delivery fees, minimum orders, delivery times, and ratings
- Supabase MCP is now configured (.claude.json)
- Need to find where operational data lives in menuca_v3 schema

Your task:
1. Use Supabase MCP tools to explore the schema
2. Find tables with: delivery_fee, minimum_order, estimated_delivery_time, ratings
3. Update /app/api/ai-search/route.ts to query real data (currently line 44-102)
4. Deploy and test

Start by running:
```
mcp__supabase__list_tables
```

Then look for tables related to operations, delivery, fees, or reviews.
