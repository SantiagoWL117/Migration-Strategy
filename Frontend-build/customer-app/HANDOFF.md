## 💡 Context for Next Developer

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Why Yelp?**
   - Established review platform with reliable API
   - 5,000 free API calls/day (sufficient for our needs)
   - Rich review data with ratings, text, user info

2. **Database Design**
   - Single `restaurant_reviews` table for all review sources
   - `source` column distinguishes Yelp vs native reviews
   - `user_id` nullable to support external reviews
   - Yelp-specific fields prefixed with `yelp_` or `external_`

3. **AI Search Approach**
   - Aggregate ratings in-memory (not database view) for flexibility
   - 5-minute cache to reduce database load
   - Graceful degradation: restaurants without ratings still shown

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - 250ms between requests (4 req/sec)
   - 2x delay between restaurants (500ms)
   - Automatic retry on 429 rate limit errors
   - Total import time: ~8-10 minutes for 152 restaurants

### Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Match Rate:** Only 56.6% of restaurants matched with Yelp
   - Different business names
   - Missing/incorrect addresses
   - No Yelp listing

2. **Review Limits:** Max 3-7 reviews per restaurant (Yelp API free tier)

3. **Review Text:** Truncated to 160 characters

4. **Static Data:** Reviews are snapshot, need to re-run script to refresh

5. **No Real-Time Updates:** Not watching for new Yelp reviews

### Dependencies

```bash
# Already installed
- @supabase/supabase-js (database client)
- dotenv (environment variables)
- tsx (TypeScript execution)

# No new npm packages required!
```
