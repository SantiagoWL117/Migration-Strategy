## Business Logic Analysis

### Status Validation Logic (✅ EXCELLENT)

**Implementation:**
```sql
IF v_order.order_status != 'pending' THEN
  RETURN jsonb_build_object(
    'success', false,
    'error', 'Order cannot be cancelled. Current status: ' || v_order.order_status,
    'reason', CASE v_order.order_status
      WHEN 'preparing' THEN 'Order is being prepared by the restaurant'
      WHEN 'ready' THEN 'Order is ready for pickup/delivery'
      WHEN 'out_for_delivery' THEN 'Order is out for delivery'
      WHEN 'delivered' THEN 'Order has already been delivered'
      WHEN 'cancelled' THEN 'Order is already cancelled'
      ELSE 'Order status does not allow cancellation'
    END
  );
END IF;
```

**Analysis:**
- ✅ **Clear business rule:** Only 'pending' status allows cancellation
- ✅ **Context-aware errors:** Different messages for each status
- ✅ **Idempotency:** Prevents re-cancelling cancelled orders
- ✅ **Future-proof:** ELSE clause handles unknown statuses

**Business Justification:**
- **Pending:** Restaurant hasn't started → Safe to cancel
- **Preparing:** Food being cooked → Too late (waste)
- **Ready:** Order complete → Customer should receive
- **Delivered:** Already with customer → No refund

**Assessment:** ✅ **CORRECT BUSINESS LOGIC**

---

### Authorization Logic Analysis

#### Authenticated Users (✅ EXCELLENT)

**Implementation:**
```sql
IF v_order.is_guest_order THEN
  -- Guest authorization (see below)
ELSE
  -- Authenticated order: verify user_id
  IF p_user_id IS NULL OR v_order.user_id != p_user_id THEN
    RETURN jsonb_build_object(
      'success', false, 
      'error', 'Unauthorized: You can only cancel your own orders'
    );
  END IF;
END IF;
```

**Security Analysis:**
- ✅ **Ownership verification:** Ensures `p_user_id = v_order.user_id`
- ✅ **NULL check:** Prevents NULL user_id bypass
- ✅ **Clear error message:** Informs user why access denied

**Test Evidence:** Test 5 confirmed unauthorized access blocked

**Assessment:** ✅ **SECURE AUTHORIZATION**

---

#### Guest Users (✅ GOOD with Caveat)

**Implementation:**
```sql
IF v_order.is_guest_order THEN
  -- Guest order: verify email
  IF p_guest_email IS NULL OR v_order.guest_email != p_guest_email THEN
    RETURN jsonb_build_object(
      'success', false, 
      'error', 'Unauthorized: Email does not match order'
    );
  END IF;
END IF;
```

**Security Analysis:**
- ✅ **Email verification:** Ensures `p_guest_email = v_order.guest_email`
- ✅ **NULL check:** Prevents NULL email bypass
- ⚠️ **Known risk:** Email is less secure than user authentication

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Attack Vector:** Attacker needs to know both order ID AND email
- **Likelihood:** LOW (order IDs not easily guessable, emails not public)
- **Impact:** MEDIUM (could cancel someone else's order)
- **Mitigation:** Email + order number verification, confirmation emails

**Test Status:** ⚠️ Not explicitly tested (guest orders not created in tests)

**Recommendation:** Add guest order test in Phase 4 when guest checkout is functional

**Assessment:** ✅ **ACCEPTABLE for Phase 0** (low risk, improvements recommended for Phase 8)

---

## Function Logic Review

### cancel_customer_order() - Deep Dive

**Function Signature:**
```sql
cancel_customer_order(
  p_order_id BIGINT,
  p_user_id BIGINT DEFAULT NULL,
  p_guest_email TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  p_cancellation_reason TEXT DEFAULT 'Customer requested cancellation'
)
RETURNS JSONB
```

**Logic Flow:**
1. ✅ **Fetch order** - SELECT with order ID
2. ✅ **Order existence check** - IF NOT FOUND
3. ✅ **Authorization** - Verify ownership (user_id OR guest_email)
4. ✅ **Status validation** - Check if 'pending'
5. ✅ **Update order** - SET status, reason, timestamp
6. ✅ **Build response** - Return detailed JSONB

**Error Handling:**
- ✅ Order not found → `success: false`
- ✅ Unauthorized → Clear error message
- ✅ Wrong status → Context-aware rejection

**Edge Cases Handled:**
- ✅ NULL user_id (guest orders)
- ✅ NULL guest_email (authenticated orders)
- ✅ Already cancelled (idempotency)
- ✅ Unknown status (ELSE clause)

**Edge Cases NOT Handled (Acceptable):**
- ⚠️ Concurrent cancellations (rare, database handles via MVCC)
- ⚠️ Rate limiting (Phase 8)
- ⚠️ Time-based restrictions (Phase 4 if needed)

**Function Quality Score:** 9/10 (excellent)

---

### get_cancellation_policy() - Deep Dive

**Function Signature:**
```sql
get_cancellation_policy(p_order_id BIGINT)
RETURNS JSONB
```

**Purpose:** Frontend helper to check if order can be cancelled

**Logic:**
- ✅ Fetch order status
- ✅ Use CASE statement to determine policy
- ✅ Return structured response with reasoning

**Output Structure:**
```json
{
  "can_cancel": boolean,
  "current_status": string,
  "reason": string,
  "cancellation_window": string,
  "policy": string
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Frontend can show/hide cancel button
- ✅ User-friendly explanations
- ✅ Consistent policy messaging
- ✅ No database writes (read-only)

**Security:** `SECURITY DEFINER` is safe here (read-only, no sensitive data)

**Function Quality Score:** 10/10 (perfect for purpose)

---

## Schema Changes Analysis

### Columns Added (✅ CORRECT)

| Column | Type | Nullable | Purpose | Assessment |
|--------|------|----------|---------|------------|
| `cancellation_reason` | TEXT | YES | Customer explanation | ✅ Correct |
| `cancelled_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | YES | When cancelled | ✅ Already existed |
| `cancelled_by` | BIGINT | YES | User who cancelled | ✅ Correct (FK to users) |

**Design Decisions:**
- ✅ **All nullable:** Correct (only populated for cancelled orders)
- ✅ **Foreign key on cancelled_by:** Maintains referential integrity
- ✅ **TEXT for reason:** Flexible, supports free-form input
- ✅ **TIMESTAMPTZ:** Timezone-aware timestamps

**Verification:** Schema query confirms all columns exist with correct types

---

## Known Limitations Assessment

### 1. No Guest Order Test (⚠️ ACCEPTABLE)

**Current State:** Guest logic implemented but not tested

**Impact:** LOW - Logic is sound, just not verified with test

**Recommendation:** Add test in Phase 4 when guest orders are created

**Example Test:**
```sql
-- Create guest order
INSERT INTO orders (..., is_guest_order = TRUE, guest_email = 'guest@test.com', ...);

-- Cancel with correct email
SELECT cancel_customer_order(order_id, NULL, 'guest@test.com', 'reason');
-- Expected: SUCCESS

-- Try with wrong email
SELECT cancel_customer_order(order_id, NULL, 'wrong@test.com', 'reason');
-- Expected: Unauthorized
```

---

### 2. No Stripe Refund Integration (✅ EXPECTED)

**Current State:** Returns `refund_status: 'pending_phase_5'`

**Phase 5 Will Add:**
- Edge Function to call Stripe Refunds API
- Refund status tracking
- Email confirmations

**Assessment:** ✅ Correct approach - foundation ready, implementation deferred

---

### 3. No Email Notifications (✅ EXPECTED)

**Current State:** No emails sent on cancellation

**Phase 8 Will Add:**
- Customer email: "Order cancelled. Refund processing."
- Restaurant email: "Order #X cancelled by customer."

**Assessment:** ✅ Correct approach - notifications are Phase 8 responsibility

---

### 4. No Refund Deadline (⚠️ BUSINESS DECISION)

**Current State:** Can cancel pending orders anytime

**Potential Enhancement:** Time-based restrictions
```sql
-- Example: Cannot cancel within 5 minutes of pickup time
IF v_order.pickup_time - NOW() < INTERVAL '5 minutes' THEN
  RETURN jsonb_build_object('success', false, 'error', 'Too close to pickup time');
END IF;
```

**Recommendation:** Business decision - implement in Phase 4 if product team requests

---

### 5. No Cancellation Rate Limiting (⚠️ PHASE 8 SECURITY)

**Potential Abuse:** User repeatedly orders and cancels to grief restaurant

**Risk:** LOW (requires payment, leaves audit trail)

**Mitigation Options:**
- Track cancellation count per user per day
- Flag accounts with >3 cancellations/day
- Require admin approval for habitual cancellers

**Recommendation:** Monitor in production, add rate limiting in Phase 8 if abuse detected

---

### 6. No order_status_history Table (⚠️ FUTURE ENHANCEMENT)

**Current State:** Ticket mentioned this table, but it doesn't exist

**Impact:** MEDIUM - No full status change history

**Recommendation:** Create in Phase 6 for complete audit trail

**Implementation:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE order_status_history (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id BIGINT REFERENCES orders(id),
  status VARCHAR(50),
  notes TEXT,
  changed_by BIGINT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Add to cancel_customer_order():
INSERT INTO order_status_history (order_id, status, notes, changed_by)
VALUES (p_order_id, 'cancelled', p_cancellation_reason, p_user_id);
```

---

## Security Analysis

### Authorization Security (✅ EXCELLENT)

**Authenticated Users:**
- ✅ User ID verification prevents unauthorized cancellations
- ✅ Test 5 confirmed wrong user blocked
- ✅ NULL check prevents bypass

**Guest Users:**
- ⚠️ Email-only verification (acceptable risk)
- ✅ Requires both order ID AND email (reduces attack surface)
- ⚠️ No test coverage yet (add in Phase 4)

**Overall Security Score:** 8.5/10 (very good)

---

### SQL Injection Risk (✅ ZERO RISK)

**Analysis:**
```sql
-- All queries use parameterized variables
WHERE o.id = p_order_id  -- ✅ Parameter
  AND o.user_id = p_user_id  -- ✅ Parameter

-- String concatenation only in error messages (safe)
'Order cannot be cancelled. Current status: ' || v_order.order_status
```

**Verdict:** ✅ **ZERO SQL INJECTION RISK**

---

### SECURITY DEFINER Usage (✅ ACCEPTABLE)

**Current:** Functions run with creator's permissions

**Security Analysis:**
- ✅ `cancel_customer_order()` checks authorization explicitly
- ✅ `get_cancellation_policy()` is read-only (no writes)
- ✅ No sensitive data exposed

**Alternative:** `SECURITY INVOKER` + RLS policies

**Recommendation:** Keep `SECURITY DEFINER` for Phase 0, add RLS in Phase 8

---

## Questions from Builder (Answered)

### 1. Should we add time-based cancellation restrictions?

**Answer:** ⏳ **BUSINESS DECISION - DEFER TO PHASE 4**

**Reasoning:**
- Current implementation allows anytime cancellation (simple, user-friendly)
- Time restrictions add complexity
- Product team should decide policy

**If Implemented:**
```sql
IF v_order.pickup_time IS NOT NULL 
   AND v_order.pickup_time - NOW() < INTERVAL '5 minutes' THEN
  RETURN jsonb_build_object(
    'success', false,
    'error', 'Cannot cancel within 5 minutes of pickup time'
  );
END IF;
```

---

### 2. Is guest email verification sufficient?

**Answer:** ✅ **YES, FOR PHASE 0**

**Risk Assessment:**
- Attacker needs BOTH order ID AND email
- Order IDs not easily guessable (BIGSERIAL)
- Emails not publicly accessible
- Audit trail tracks all cancellations

**Enhanced Security (Phase 8):**
- Add order number to verification
- Send confirmation email with undo link
- Add CAPTCHA to cancel button

---

### 3. Should cancelled orders be soft or hard deleted?

**Answer:** ✅ **KEEP SOFT DELETE (CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION CORRECT)**

**Reasoning:**
- ✅ Complete audit trail preserved
- ✅ Analytics on cancellation patterns
- ✅ Customer support can view history
- ✅ Refund reconciliation easier

**GDPR Consideration:** After refund complete + 7 years, can hard delete for compliance

---

### 4. Should we enforce enum for cancellation_reason?

**Answer:** ⏳ **KEEP FREE TEXT, CONSIDER ENUM IN PHASE 7**

**Current Approach:** Free text (flexible)

**Enum Approach:** Predefined reasons
```sql
CREATE TYPE cancellation_reason_enum AS ENUM (
  'changed_mind',
  'wrong_items',
  'delivery_slow',
  'found_better_price',
  'other'
);
```

**Recommendation:** 
- Phase 0: Free text (easier for users)
- Phase 7: Optional enum for analytics if needed

---

### 5. Is SECURITY DEFINER appropriate?

**Answer:** ✅ **YES, FOR PHASE 0**

**Reasoning:**
- Function checks authorization explicitly
- No sensitive data exposed
- RLS can be added in Phase 8 without breaking changes

---

### 6. Should we return different errors for "not found" vs "unauthorized"?

**Answer:** ⚠️ **CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION ACCEPTABLE, REVIEW IN PHASE 8**

**Current:** Returns "Order not found" if no match

**Security Consideration:** Attacker can probe for valid order IDs

**Recommendation:** 
- Phase 0: Keep current (better UX)
- Phase 8: Consider generic "Order not found or unauthorized"

---
