# üåø Supabase Branch Setup for Cursor vs Replit Competition

**Created:** October 21, 2025  
**Purpose:** Create isolated development branches for parallel frontend builds  
**Duration:** 1 week competition  
**Estimated Cost:** ~$50 total (prorated monthly cost)

---

## üéØ THE PLAN

Create **2 development branches** from production:

```
menuca_v3 (Production - main branch)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cursor-build (Cursor Composer + Supabase MCP)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ replit-build (Replit Agent + Supabase Connector)
```

---

## ‚úÖ BRANCH 1: cursor-build

**Purpose:** Cursor Composer development environment

**Features:**
- Full copy of all 74 production tables
- All migrations applied
- Separate project URL & credentials
- Supabase MCP integration for schema intelligence
- Direct database access from Cursor

**Access:**
```bash
# Once created, you'll get:
Project URL: https://cursor-build-[project-ref].supabase.co
Anon Key: [separate anon key]
Service Role Key: [separate service key]

# Use these in Cursor's .env:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://cursor-build-[project-ref].supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[anon-key]
```

---

## ‚úÖ BRANCH 2: replit-build

**Purpose:** Replit Agent development environment

**Features:**
- Full copy of all 74 production tables
- All migrations applied
- Separate project URL & credentials
- Supabase connector for Replit
- Hosted testing environment

**Access:**
```bash
# Once created, you'll get:
Project URL: https://replit-build-[project-ref].supabase.co
Anon Key: [separate anon key]
Service Role Key: [separate service key]

# Use these in Replit's .env:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://replit-build-[project-ref].supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[anon-key]
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è CREATION METHODS

### **Option A: Supabase Dashboard (EASIEST)** ‚úÖ

1. Go to [https://supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your MenuCA V3 project
3. Click **"Branches"** in sidebar
4. Click **"Create Branch"**
5. Name: `cursor-build`
6. Confirm cost (~$25/month, prorated)
7. Wait ~2-3 minutes for provisioning
8. Copy credentials

9. Repeat for `replit-build`

**This is the recommended method!**

---

### **Option B: Supabase CLI**

```bash
# Install Supabase CLI (if not installed):
brew install supabase/tap/supabase

# Login:
supabase login

# Link to your project:
supabase link --project-ref [your-project-ref]

# Create cursor-build branch:
supabase branches create cursor-build

# Create replit-build branch:
supabase branches create replit-build

# List branches to verify:
supabase branches list
```

---

### **Option C: Supabase MCP (Via Cursor)**

**Note:** The MCP requires cost confirmation through Supabase dashboard first.

```typescript
// Once cost is confirmed in dashboard, you can manage branches via MCP:
- List branches
- Switch between branches
- Merge branches
- Delete branches
```

---

## üìã AFTER BRANCH CREATION

### **1. Get Branch Credentials**

For each branch, save these to your password manager:

```
Branch Name: cursor-build
Project URL: [from dashboard]
Project Ref: [from dashboard]
Anon Key: [from dashboard]
Service Role Key: [from dashboard]
Database Password: [from dashboard]
```

```
Branch Name: replit-build
Project URL: [from dashboard]
Project Ref: [from dashboard]
Anon Key: [from dashboard]
Service Role Key: [from dashboard]
Database Password: [from dashboard]
```

---

### **2. Create Environment Files**

**For Cursor build (`cursor-build` branch):**

Create `/cursor-frontend/.env.local`:
```bash
# Cursor Build - Development Branch
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://cursor-build-[ref].supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[cursor-anon-key]
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=[cursor-service-key]

# Stripe (use test keys)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=[stripe-test-pk]
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=[stripe-test-sk]

# App Config
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**For Replit build (`replit-build` branch):**

Create environment variables in Replit Secrets:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://replit-build-[ref].supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[replit-anon-key]
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=[replit-service-key]

NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=[stripe-test-pk]
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=[stripe-test-sk]

NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=[replit-url]
```

---

### **3. Configure Cursor for cursor-build Branch**

In Cursor, update your Supabase MCP config to point to the branch:

```json
// .cursor/mcp.json or wherever your MCP config lives
{
  "supabase": {
    "projectRef": "[cursor-build-ref]",
    "accessToken": "[your-supabase-token]"
  }
}
```

Now Cursor's Supabase MCP will query the **cursor-build branch database**!

---

### **4. Configure Replit for replit-build Branch**

In Replit:

1. Open Secrets panel
2. Add all environment variables listed above
3. Use the **replit-build** credentials
4. Restart your Repl

## üéØ COMPETITION WORKFLOW

### **Day 0-2: Phase 0 Fixes (Together)**

Before the competition starts, complete Phase 0 together:

- [ ] Create `PHASE_0_DATABASE_UPDATES.sql`
- [ ] Apply to **main branch** (production)
- [ ] Test migrations work
- [ ] Then create branches (they'll inherit Phase 0 fixes)

**Why?** Both builds need the same foundation (guest checkout, inventory, security functions)

---

### **Day 3-9: Parallel Building**

**Cursor Track:**
```
Day 3-4: Phase 1-2 (Foundation + Menu Display)
Day 5: Phase 3 (Cart System)
Day 6-7: Phase 4 (Checkout)
Day 8-9: Phase 5 (Payment)
```

**Replit Track:**
```
Day 3-4: Phase 1-2 (Foundation + Menu Display)
Day 5: Phase 3 (Cart System)
Day 6-7: Phase 4 (Checkout)
Day 8-9: Phase 5 (Payment)
```

Both follow same plan, different tools!

---

### **Day 10: Comparison & Decision**

**Compare:**
1. Run both apps side-by-side
2. Test all features
3. Check code quality
4. Review test coverage
5. Measure performance
6. Note any bugs

**Decide:**
- Which build won?
- Merge winner to production
- Delete both branches (cleanup)
- Document lessons learned

---

## üîÑ AFTER COMPETITION

### **Merge Winner:**

```bash
# Via Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to Branches
2. Select winning branch
3. Click "Merge to Production"
4. Review changes
5. Confirm merge

# This will:
- Apply any new migrations to production
- Deploy any Edge Functions
- Update production schema
```

### **Delete Both Branches:**

```bash
# Via Dashboard:
1. Go to Branches
2. Select cursor-build
3. Click "Delete Branch"
4. Confirm

5. Select replit-build
6. Click "Delete Branch"
7. Confirm

# Stops billing immediately!
```

### **Document Results:**

Create `CURSOR_VS_REPLIT_RESULTS.md` with:
- Which won and why
- Key differences
- Lessons learned
- Future tool choice recommendation

## üí∞ COST BREAKDOWN

**Expected costs for 1-week competition:**

```
cursor-build branch:
- ~$25/month prorated to 7 days = ~$6
- Compute: $0.01/hour √ó 168 hours = ~$2
- Storage: Minimal
Total: ~$8

replit-build branch:
- ~$25/month prorated to 7 days = ~$6
- Compute: $0.01/hour √ó 168 hours = ~$2
- Storage: Minimal
Total: ~$8

TOTAL COMPETITION COST: ~$16-20
```

**You were right - totally worth it for a week! üéâ**

---

## üö® IMPORTANT NOTES

### **Data Isolation:**
- Each branch is **completely isolated**
- Changes in cursor-build DON'T affect replit-build
- Neither affects production
- Perfect for parallel development!

### **Schema Sync:**
- Both start with same 74 tables
- If you add tables during competition, they diverge
- That's fine! You're testing approaches
- Winner's schema gets merged

### **No Risk:**
- Production database untouched
- Can delete branches anytime
- Cost stops immediately when deleted
- Zero downside!

**Let's do this! May the best tool win! üöÄ**

**P.S.** Once you create the branches in the dashboard, share the credentials and we'll configure both environments properly!
