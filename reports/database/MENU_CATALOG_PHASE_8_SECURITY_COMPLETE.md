# Menu & Catalog Refactoring - Phase 8: Security & RLS Enhancement ✅ COMPLETE

**Date:** 2025-10-30  
**Status:** ✅ **SUCCESS**  
**Objective:** Enable RLS and create security policies for all new Menu & Catalog tables

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully enabled Row-Level Security (RLS) on all 5 new Menu & Catalog tables and created comprehensive security policies following the enterprise pattern. All tables now have proper access control: public read for active dishes, admin management via restaurant_id, and service role full access.

---

## Migration Results

### 8.1 RLS Enabled

**Tables with RLS Enabled:**
- ✅ `dish_allergens` - RLS enabled
- ✅ `dish_dietary_tags` - RLS enabled
- ✅ `dish_size_options` - RLS enabled
- ✅ `dish_ingredients` - RLS enabled
- ✅ `modifier_groups` - RLS enabled

**Note:** `combo_steps` already had RLS enabled from Phase 4.

### 8.2 Security Policies Created

**Policy Pattern (Applied to All Tables):**

1. **Public Read Policy** (`*_public_read`)
   - **Roles:** `anon`, `authenticated`
   - **Access:** SELECT only
   - **Condition:** Only active dishes (is_active = true, deleted_at IS NULL)
   - **Purpose:** Allow public menu browsing while protecting inactive/deleted data

2. **Admin Management Policy** (`*_admin_manage`)
   - **Roles:** `authenticated`
   - **Access:** ALL (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
   - **Condition:** Admin must be:
     - Active admin user (status = 'active', deleted_at IS NULL)
     - Assigned to restaurant via `admin_user_restaurants`
     - Dish belongs to that restaurant
   - **Purpose:** Restaurant admins can manage their own menu data

3. **Service Role Policy** (`*_service_role`)
   - **Roles:** `service_role`
   - **Access:** ALL (full access)
   - **Condition:** Always true
   - **Purpose:** Backend services can bypass RLS for migrations, batch operations

**Policies Created:**
- `dish_allergens`: 3 policies (public_read, admin_manage, service_role)
- `dish_dietary_tags`: 3 policies (public_read, admin_manage, service_role)
- `dish_size_options`: 3 policies (public_read, admin_manage, service_role)
- `dish_ingredients`: 3 policies (public_read, admin_manage, service_role)
- `modifier_groups`: 3 policies (public_read, admin_manage, service_role)

**Total:** 15 policies created

## Security Verification

### RLS Status
All 5 new tables have RLS enabled ✅

### Policy Coverage
All tables have 3 policies (public read, admin manage, service role) ✅

### Security Pattern Compliance
- ✅ Uses `restaurant_id` (NOT tenant_id) for access control
- ✅ Checks admin assignment via `admin_user_restaurants`
- ✅ Validates admin status and soft-delete status
- ✅ Public policies filter by dish `is_active` and `deleted_at`
- ✅ Service role has full access for backend operations

---

## Security Advisor Results

**From Supabase Security Advisor:**

**New Tables Requiring RLS (Now Fixed):**
- ✅ `dish_allergens` - RLS enabled
- ✅ `dish_dietary_tags` - RLS enabled
- ✅ `dish_size_options` - RLS enabled
- ✅ `dish_ingredients` - RLS enabled
- ✅ `modifier_groups` - RLS enabled

**Other Security Issues Found (Not Related to Menu & Catalog):**
- Multiple views with SECURITY DEFINER (existing issue, not from refactoring)
- Multiple functions with mutable search_path (existing issue, not critical)
- Many other tables without RLS (existing issue, outside scope of this refactoring)

**Menu & Catalog Tables:** All new tables now secure ✅

## Access Control Pattern

### Public Access (Customers)
```sql
-- Customers can see allergens for active dishes
SELECT * FROM menuca_v3.dish_allergens
WHERE dish_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM menuca_v3.dishes 
    WHERE is_active = true AND deleted_at IS NULL
);
```

### Admin Access (Restaurant Owners)
```sql
-- Admins can manage allergens for their restaurants
-- Automatically filtered by admin_user_restaurants relationship
INSERT INTO menuca_v3.dish_allergens (dish_id, allergen, severity)
VALUES (123, 'peanuts', 'contains');
-- Only succeeds if admin is assigned to dish's restaurant
```

### Service Role (Backend)
```sql
-- Backend services have full access
-- Used for migrations, batch imports, etc.
-- Bypasses RLS checks
```

---

## Migration Safety

- ✅ RLS enabled before policies created (prevents accidental exposure)
- ✅ Policies use same pattern as existing tables (consistency)
- ✅ All policies tested with proper conditions
- ✅ Service role policy ensures migrations still work

**Rollback Capability:** Can drop policies and disable RLS if needed

---

## Files Modified

- ✅ `menuca_v3.dish_allergens` (RLS enabled, 3 policies)
- ✅ `menuca_v3.dish_dietary_tags` (RLS enabled, 3 policies)
- ✅ `menuca_v3.dish_size_options` (RLS enabled, 3 policies)
- ✅ `menuca_v3.dish_ingredients` (RLS enabled, 3 policies)
- ✅ `menuca_v3.modifier_groups` (RLS enabled, 3 policies)

---

## Next Steps

✅ **Phase 8 Complete** - All new tables secured with RLS

**Ready for Phase 9:** Data Quality & Cleanup
- Fix orphaned records
- Standardize names (trim whitespace)
- Validate foreign keys
- Remove duplicates

**Security Status:** All Menu & Catalog refactoring tables are now secure ✅
