### ✅ Check 2: Translation Coverage

**Objective:** Check current translation data coverage

**Results:**

**dish_translations:**
- **Total Translations:** 2 rows
- **Unique Dishes Translated:** 2 dishes
- **Unique Languages:** 1 language

### ⚠️ Check 3: Dishes Needing Translation

**Objective:** Identify dishes needing translation

**Results:**
- **Dishes Needing Translation:** 22,657 dishes
- **Restaurants Affected:** 626 restaurants

**Status:** ⚠️ **INFO** - Most dishes need translation (expected)

**Analysis:**
- Most active dishes (22,657) have < 3 translations
- Infrastructure ready for translation population
- Translation can be added incrementally

**Recommendation:**
- Plan for translation population (manual or AI-assisted)
- Consider marking dishes as "needs translation"
- Or auto-translate using AI/translation service
