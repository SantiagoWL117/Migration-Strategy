## 🆕 **NEWLY ADDED POLICY**

### **Policy:** `user_favorites_admin_select`

**Table:** `menuca_v3.user_favorite_restaurants`  
**Role:** `authenticated`  
**Command:** `SELECT`  
**Purpose:** Allow restaurant admins to view favorites for their restaurants

**SQL:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY user_favorites_admin_select
ON menuca_v3.user_favorite_restaurants
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM menuca_v3.admin_user_restaurants aur
    JOIN menuca_v3.admin_users au ON au.id = aur.admin_user_id
    WHERE aur.restaurant_id = user_favorite_restaurants.restaurant_id
      AND au.auth_user_id = auth.uid()
      AND au.status = 'active'::menuca_v3.admin_user_status
      AND au.deleted_at IS NULL
  )
);
```

**What This Enables:**
- ✅ Admins can see who favorited their restaurants
- ✅ Analytics: "Your restaurant has 50 favorites"
- ✅ Marketing: Identify loyal customers
- ✅ Insights: Track favorite trends over time

**Security:**
- 🔒 Admins can ONLY see favorites for restaurants they manage
- 🔒 Cannot see favorites for other restaurants
- 🔒 Enforces tenant isolation
- 🔒 Respects admin status (active only) and soft deletes

## 🎯 **RLS POLICY PATTERNS EXPLAINED**

### **Pattern 1: Direct Auth Check**
```sql
-- User accessing their own record
USING (auth.uid() = auth_user_id AND deleted_at IS NULL)
```
**Use Case:** Customer profile, admin profile

### **Pattern 2: Related Record Check**
```sql
-- User accessing related records (addresses, favorites)
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM menuca_v3.users u
    WHERE u.id = [table].user_id
      AND u.auth_user_id = auth.uid()
      AND u.deleted_at IS NULL
  )
)
```
**Use Case:** Customer addresses, customer favorites

### **Pattern 3: Tenant Isolation (Admin Access)**
```sql
-- Admin accessing assigned restaurant data
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM menuca_v3.admin_user_restaurants aur
    JOIN menuca_v3.admin_users au ON au.id = aur.admin_user_id
    WHERE aur.restaurant_id = [table].restaurant_id
      AND au.auth_user_id = auth.uid()
      AND au.status = 'active'
      AND au.deleted_at IS NULL
  )
)
```
**Use Case:** Admin viewing restaurant favorites, orders, etc.

### **Pattern 4: Service Role (Backend Access)**
```sql
-- Backend API with full access
FOR ALL TO service_role
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true)
```
**Use Case:** Admin operations, migrations, bulk updates
