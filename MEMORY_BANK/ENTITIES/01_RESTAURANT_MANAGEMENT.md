## 🔧 Status Correction Applied (2025-10-14)

**Issue Identified:** V2 data overwrote V1 data during migration, but 99% of restaurants remained operational in V1 after an abandoned V2 migration attempt years ago. These were marked `suspended` or `pending` in V2, causing incorrect status in V3.

**Solution Applied:** Priority rule - "If active in EITHER V1 OR V2 → active in V3"

**Corrections Made:**
- ✅ 101 restaurants updated to `active` status
- 87 suspended → active
- 14 pending → active  
- 3 suspended_at timestamps cleared

**Status Distribution Change:**
- Suspended: 736 → 649 (-87)
- Active: 158 → 259 (+101)
- Pending: 50 → 36 (-14)

**Files Created:**
- `staging.active_restaurant_corrections` - Audit trail (101 records)
- `update_active_status_corrections.sql` - Execution script
- `ACTIVE_STATUS_CORRECTION_SUMMARY.md` - Analysis & plan
- `EXECUTION_REPORT_ACTIVE_STATUS_CORRECTION.md` - Final report

**Verification:** ✅ All 101 corrections applied successfully, FK integrity maintained, transaction committed.

**Note:** Restaurant Management entity complete. Status correction applied based on V1 active data priority.
