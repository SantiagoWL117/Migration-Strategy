# Restaurant Status Correction - Completion Summary

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Type:** Data Correction (Post-Migration Fix)  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Impact:** 101 restaurants corrected to active status

---

## 📋 Problem Summary

During the V1→V2→V3 migration, V2 data overwrote V1 data with priority given to V2 values. However:

- Someone attempted a V1→V2 migration years ago (never completed)
- **99% of restaurants remained operational in V1 database**
- These restaurants were marked as `inactive`, `suspended`, or `pending` in V2
- V3 inherited these incorrect statuses from V2

**Result:** 101 actively operating restaurants were incorrectly marked in V3

---

## 🎯 Solution Applied

**Priority Rule:** "If active in EITHER V1 OR V2 → active in V3"

### Corrections Made:
- ✅ **101 restaurants** updated to `active` status
- ✅ **87** changed from `suspended` → `active`
- ✅ **14** changed from `pending` → `active`
- ✅ **3** `suspended_at` timestamps cleared

---

## 📊 Analysis Results

### V1 Active Restaurants: 228 total
- ✅ 125 already correct as `active` in V3
- ❌ **87 incorrectly marked as `suspended`** in V3
- ❌ **14 incorrectly marked as `pending`** in V3
- ⚠️ 2 missing from V3 (test restaurants)

### V2 Active Restaurants: 25 total
- ✅ All 25 already correct as `active` in V3
- ✅ No corrections needed

### Total Corrections: 101 restaurants

## 🔍 Special Cases

### 3 Restaurants with Suspended Timestamps (Cleared):

| V3 ID | Restaurant Name | Previous Status | Suspended At | Action |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|---------|
| 47 | Mr Mozzarella - Nepean | suspended | 2025-01-12 | ✅ Cleared, set active |
| 223 | 2 for 1 Pizza | suspended | 2023-04-14 | ✅ Cleared, set active |
| 468 | Just Wok | suspended | 2022-10-31 | ✅ Cleared, set active |

**Decision:** These restaurants were active in V1, so `suspended_at` timestamps were cleared and status set to `active`.

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What We Discovered:
1. **Migration Priority Logic:** V2 data priority worked for most cases but not for status fields
2. **Active Status Priority:** Should check BOTH sources for active status, not just prefer V2
3. **Abandoned Migrations:** Years-old incomplete migrations can cause unexpected data issues
4. **Staging Tables:** Invaluable for review and audit trail

### Process Improvements:
1. ✅ **Staging table first** - Created review table before any production changes
2. ✅ **Transaction-wrapped** - Full rollback capability maintained
3. ✅ **Comprehensive verification** - Pre and post-execution validation
4. ✅ **Complete documentation** - Audit trail preserved

### For Future Migrations:
- Consider "active" status as highest priority across all sources
- Always check BOTH V1 and V2 for operational status
- Document any status override logic clearly
- Preserve audit trail in staging tables
