## üéØ Options for Next Entity

### Option 1: Users & Access (RECOMMENDED)

**Priority:** HIGH  
**Blocked:** No - Ready to start ‚úÖ  
**Why:** High priority, clear scope, unblocks Orders

**Tables to migrate:**
- `site_users` - Customer accounts
- `admin_users` - Platform administrators  
- `site_users_delivery_addresses` - User addresses (needs cities/provinces ‚úÖ)
- `site_users_favorite_restaurants` - User favorites
- Related auth/session tables

**Next Actions:**
1. Read V1/V2 Users & Access table schemas
2. Create mapping document
3. Create migration plans
4. Export CSV data
5. Execute migrations

**See:** `MEMORY_BANK/ENTITIES/08_USERS_ACCESS.md` (to be created)

---

### Option 2: Delivery Operations

**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Blocked:** No - Ready to start ‚úÖ  
**Why:** Independent, can run in parallel with other work

**Tables to migrate:**
- `restaurants_delivery_areas` - Delivery zone polygons
- `restaurants_delivery_fees` - Fee structure by distance
- `restaurants_delivery_info` - Delivery company integration
- `restaurants_disable_delivery` - Temporary delivery suspensions

**Next Actions:**
1. Read V1/V2 Delivery tables
2. Create mapping document
3. Understand PostGIS geometry types
4. Create migration plans
5. Export CSV data

**See:** `MEMORY_BANK/ENTITIES/04_DELIVERY_OPERATIONS.md` (to be created)

---

### Option 3: Wait for Restaurant Management

**Priority:** Coordinate with other developer  
**Why:** Many entities depend on Restaurant Management being complete

**Blocked Entities (waiting for Restaurant Management):**
- Service Configuration & Schedules
- Menu & Catalog
- Marketing & Promotions
- Vendors & Franchises
- Devices & Infrastructure

**Action:** Check with Restaurant Management developer on their progress

## üöÄ Recommended Approach

**Immediate:** Choose Users & Access (Option 1)

3. Clear table scope
4. Independent from Restaurant Management
5. Can complete while other developer works

**First Step:** Analyze Users & Access tables in V1 and V2
