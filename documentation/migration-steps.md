# Migration Strategy Overview

## Original Process Definition

**Purpose:** 
Extract step:
    1.    Field mapping:
    2. Verification: Review other possible tables that could be useful in V1 and V2
    3. Santiago step: Based on field mapping, add Dump of the required data to the Project for further analysis.
    4. Create the menuca_v3 tables according to the columns and format of the data dumps.
    5.  Extract data as CSV from the tables and columns defined in step 1 (Field mapping) 
    6.  Based on the CSV data build the staging tables. please suggest p[olicies for me to review before implimenting
Transform Step:
    1. Verify format discrepencies accoross the CSV file
Load step: 
    1. Build a transaction for the Transform and Upsert step to load the data from the staging tables to the menuca_v3 tables
Verification step: 
     Create verification queries that verify data integrity and that ensure that all the relevant data was migrated from the staging tables to menuca_v3 tables. Always include an explanation of the query and the expected outcome.

## Standard Migration Process

### Purpose
Migrate data from legacy systems (V1/V2) to the new V3 schema using an ETL approach.

### Extract Step:
1. **(AI responsibility)** Field mapping: Analyze source and target schemas
2. **(User responsibility)** Review other possible tables that could be useful in V1 and V2
3. **(User responsibility)** Based on field mapping, add Dump of the required data to the Project for further analysis
4. **(AI responsibility)** Preconditions: Create the menuca_v3 tables according to the columns and format of the data dumps
5. **(User responsibility)** Extract data as CSV from the tables and columns defined in step 1 (Field mapping) 
6. **(AI responsibility)** Based on the CSV data build the staging tables

### Transform Step:
1. Verify format discrepancies across the CSV file
2. Handle data type conversions
3. Resolve conflicts between V1 and V2 sources
4. Apply business rules and validations
5. Generate audit trails

### Load Step: 
1. Build a Transform and Upsert step to load the data from the staging tables to the menuca_v3 tables
2. Handle foreign key relationships
3. Maintain referential integrity

### Verification Step: 
**(AI responsibility)** Create verification queries that verify data integrity and that ensure that all the relevant data was migrated from the staging tables to menuca_v3 tables. Always include an explanation of the query and the expected outcome.
