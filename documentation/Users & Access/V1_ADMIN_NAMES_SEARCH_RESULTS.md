## 🔍 DETAILED FINDINGS

### Exact Name Match Search

```sql
-- Searched for exact first_name + last_name combinations
WHERE 
    (first_name = 'Eddie' AND last_name = 'Laham')
    OR (first_name = 'Resto' AND last_name = 'Zone')
    OR (first_name = 'Mahde' AND last_name = 'Ghandour')
    OR (first_name = 'assal' AND last_name = 'leas')
```

**Result:** ❌ **0 matches found**

---

### Email Search

```sql
-- Searched for their V1 admin email addresses
WHERE email IN (
    'assal@gmail.com',
    'contact@restozone.ca',
    'sales@menu.ca',
    'allout613@alloutburger.com'
)
```

**Result:** ❌ **0 matches found**

---

### Partial Name Search (Broader)

I also searched for partial matches (LIKE '%name%') to catch variations:

**Similar names found (but NOT matches):**

| V3 User | Email | First Name | Last Name | Assessment |
|---------|-------|------------|-----------|------------|
| ID: 26057 | eladouceur@jobzonedemploi.ca | Job | Zone | ❌ NOT "Resto Zone" - Different person (Job Zone employment service) |
| ID: 25992 | eddiedrueding@hotmail.com | Eddie | Drueding | ❌ NOT "Eddie Laham" - Different last name |
| ID: 33681 | m.eduardo_montes@hotmail.com | Eddie | Montes | ❌ NOT "Eddie Laham" - Different last name |

**Conclusion:** These are **different people**, not the V1 admins we're looking for.

## 🎯 CONCLUSION

**Answer:** ❌ **NO - None of the 4 V1 admin names exist in menuca_v3.users**

**What this means:**

1. ❌ They're NOT in `menuca_v3.admin_users` (confirmed earlier)
2. ❌ They're NOT in `menuca_v3.users` (just confirmed)
3. ❌ **They are NOT in V3 at all** - completely excluded

**Why this matters:**

These 4 admins were:
- **NOT migrated** from V1 to V2 (because activeUser = 0)
- **NOT accidentally migrated** to the users table instead of admin_users
- **Completely excluded** from V3

**Impact:**

| Admin | Permissions Lost | Restaurant Access | Priority |
|-------|------------------|-------------------|----------|
| assal@gmail.com | 1,677 bytes (super admin) | 97 restaurants | 🔴 **HIGH** |
| contact@restozone.ca | 352 bytes (vendor) | 22 restaurants | ⚠️ **MEDIUM-HIGH** |
| Allout613@alloutburger.com | 106 bytes (owner) | 5 restaurants | ⚠️ **MEDIUM** |
| sales@menu.ca | NONE (0 bytes) | 0 restaurants | ✅ **LOW** |

## 📋 NEXT STEPS RECOMMENDATION

### For assal@gmail.com (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Problem:** Lost access to 97 restaurants + super admin permissions

**Options:**
1. **Search V3 admins by restaurant overlap:**
   - Find V3 admins with access to 50+ restaurants
   - One might be "assal" with a different email
   
2. **Contact directly:**
   - Email assal@gmail.com
   - Ask: "Were you an admin on Menu.ca?"
   - If yes: Create new V3 account

3. **Check V1 system status:**
   - If V1 still running, they might still be using it
   - Migrate them urgently before V1 shutdown
